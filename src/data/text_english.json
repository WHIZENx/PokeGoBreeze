  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_00_01": "The weather\u2019s still going haywire, and we have multiple confirmed sightings of Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ve left a streak of destruction in their wake.",

  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_01_post_branch_03": "The Orbs have some influence over Primal Reversion. This is the transformation Kyogre and Groudon undergo when they absorb an abundance of natural energy.",

  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_01": "This chase has led us past a diverse array of Pok\u00e9mon. It could signal that there is something of interest nearby, such as one of the Orbs.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_02": "It is also possible that Pok\u00e9mon are attracted to\u2014not merely attuned to\u2014natural energy. Perhaps we are near one that has undergone Primal Reversion...",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_03": "But we need not fear. I am confident you and your Pok\u00e9mon can fend off Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. In the meantime, let us review what we know of them.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_04": "According to Professor Willow, Groudon has long been described in mythology as the Pok\u00e9mon that raised lands and expanded continents.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_05": "Legends tell of its many clashes against Kyogre, as each sought to gain the power of nature. Could Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon be fighting once again? That would explain the strange weather.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_06": "And speaking of strange, look there\u2014a scarlet glint, coming from that cave. Hm? You cannot see it? Worry not. I shall investigate.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_02_07": "In the meantime, I hear a telltale cry growing nearer. Could it be Primal Groudon?",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_00": "Thank you for keeping Primal Groudon at bay, %PLAYERNAME%. Here is my contribution\u2014the Red Orb.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_01": "The cave I found it in was most impressive. The Red Orb shone with a brilliant crimson light atop something like an altar. Perhaps it was an object of worship in a time long past.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_02": "Only the Blue Orb remains. It is associated with Kyogre, if I am not mistaken.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_03_03": "I have read that Kyogre is able to create massive rain clouds that cover the entire sky and bring about torrential downpours. It has appeared in mythology as the creator of the sea.",

  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_01": "While you were away, I followed the path of the rain\u2019s runoff. It led me to another mysterious cavern, this time filled with an azure light. The Blue Orb was atop a shining altar. I wish we could have beheld it together.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_02": "Now, with both Orbs in our possession, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon will cease their rampage.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_03": "Climatic conditions should soon stabilize, and natural forces will once again find harmony.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_04": "Thank you for your assistance today. I would not have been able to recover the Orbs without the protection provided by you and your Pok\u00e9mon.",

  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_06": "All our talk of Kyogre and Groudon\u2019s might has sparked my curiosity.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_04_07": "Now that we can safely observe Primal Reversion with the Orbs in our possession, could you give me a demonstration of the phenomenon, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_00": "%PLAYERNAME%! There you are. The weather\u2019s finally stopped going topsy-turvy! I take that to mean you and Rhi were successful in finding the Red and Blue Orbs.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_01": "You two are amazing. Normally, it\u2019d take no less than Rayquaza descending to the ground to settle one of Kyogre and Groudon\u2019s \u201carguments\u201d!",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_02": "Maybe you got the jump on it. Rayquaza would have to be mighty speedy to get ahead of you two!",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_03": "Oh, that reminds me. While you and Rhi were off saving the day, I had some time to think about what could\u2019ve caused the surge of natural energy to begin with. My top theory so far is\u2014",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_04": "Hold on! Did you see that, %PLAYERNAME%?! Something bright just flew across the sky\u2014could it be a Pok\u00e9mon?",

  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_05_06": "You know where to find me when you\u2019re ready to continue your Pok\u00e9mon journey. Until then, thanks again for your help. Things just wouldn\u2019t be the same without you around!",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_branch_00": "Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "go_tour_global_sr_dialog_branch_01": "It has been some time since our last mission together. I would not have been able to learn of this world and keep the Ultra Beasts at bay without your previous assistance.",

  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_04": "I know what I\u2019m about to say is mind-boggling, but Team GO Rocket has offered to work with us to keep Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon in check.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_05": "I never thought I\u2019d see the day. I guess the blustering weather has made even Team GO Rocket\u2019s disposition turn sunny!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_06": "Will you meet with them, %PLAYERNAME%? Not only do I have every confidence in your ability to quell Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon, but I know you\u2019ll be able to stop Team GO Rocket if they try any underhanded tricks.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_00_07": "Now hurry\u2014there\u2019s no time to lose!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_00": "Hmph.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_01": "I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m being forced to work with one of Candela\u2019s friends. Unbelievable. As if I need help.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_02": "But even I know better than to disobey Giovanni, so there\u2019s no worming my way out of this one.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_03": "Just be grateful I\u2019m giving you my time. For the record, I\u2019m more than capable of handling this alone.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_04": "In fact, I\u2019ve already come up with a plan to restrain Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon. All that\u2019s left for you to do is follow my orders.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_05": "First, we\u2019re going to inspect the locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared. I\u2019m putting you in charge of recording any anomalies you see in the area.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_arlo_06": "Well? You heard me, did you not? Time to go.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_00": "FINALLY. You\u2019ve got some nerve, showing up late. I\u2019ve been waiting an entire 45 seconds!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_01": "Thought you\u2019d be better at this teamwork business, considering how much time you spend yakking with Professor Willow and that kid with the funky goggles.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_02": "Don\u2019t waste our time apologizing. And don\u2019t bother introducing yourself. We\u2019ve met enough times to skip the pleasantries.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_03": "Let\u2019s get down to business. Our bosses want us to check out a few locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_04": "Huh? What do you mean, Professor Willow\u2019s not your boss? Whatever. You got the gist.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_cliff_05": "Time to get moving. Less talking, more walking!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_00": "Well, well! Isn\u2019t this a lovely surprise? We\u2019re on the same side for once!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_01": "Don\u2019t look so concerned. There\u2019s nothing in it for me if the world sinks, shakes, or whatever it is we\u2019re supposed to be worried about.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_02": "%PLAYERNAME%, darling, you can trust me.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_03": "Not that you have many options right now\u2014especially with your esteemed team leaders and the little begoggled one otherwise occupied.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_04": "Collaborating will be a new experience for me, too. So let\u2019s find the silver lining of this debacle and learn from one another, shall we?",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_05": "First, you and your Pok\u00e9mon will accompany me to a few locations where Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon have appeared.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_01_sierra_06": "Come along. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019re made of.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_00": "I\u2019ll acknowledge you have some skill with a camera.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_01": "*sigh* Thank you, whatever your name was. This\u2019ll do.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_02": "Now I have enough information to move on with my investigation of Primal Reversion.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_03": "You look confused. Did that professor of yours never teach you about Primal Reversion?",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_04": "I bet you\u2019re thinking that if Candela were here, she could explain it. Unfortunately for you, I\u2019m your leader for today.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_05": "Hmph... Fine. I\u2019ll humor you with an explanation, if only to prove that I know more than both Candela and your professor about the subject.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_06": "Primal Reversion is a phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon can transform when they absorb massive amounts of energy from nature. It\u2019s similar to Mega Evolution, and it grants them incredible power and strength. You follow?",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_07": "Did you just...thank me? Er. Gratitude won\u2019t get you anywhere, you know.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_arlo_08": "I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not hating this alliance as much as I\u2019d expected... But don\u2019t push your luck.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_00": "Huh. These are decent snapshots.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_01": "What do I need \u2019em for? Hah! That\u2019s the smartest question you\u2019ve asked all day.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_02": "These\u2019ll help us understand Primal Reversion\u2014the phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon return to their primal forms. I\u2019ve heard Arlo say it\u2019s kind of like Mega Evolution, but powered by nature\u2019s energy.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_03": "Now you can go give Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon the smackdown.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_04": "What\u2019s that? Of course I\u2019m coming with you. We\u2019re a team today.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_05": "\u201cCan\u2019t leave a partner out to dry.\u201d That\u2019s what we used to say back on the ranch.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_06": "Didn\u2019t know I had a ranch? Guess you wouldn\u2019t. Those days are long gone, anyhow.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_07": "OK, enough chitchat. You and your Pok\u00e9mon are gonna lead the way, \u201cpartner.\u201d",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_cliff_08": "You\u2019ve kept up so far. Now show me you\u2019ve got what it takes!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_00": "These snapshots could\u2019ve been dreadful, but they\u2019re actually decent! Color me mildly impressed.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_01": "They\u2019d be better without your Pok\u00e9mon in the way. All the same, these will help us better understand Primal Reversion.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_02": "Primal Reversion? You know, the phenomenon where Kyogre and Groudon can transform when they absorb massive amounts of energy from nature. It\u2019s quite similar to Mega Evolution, but powered by a different source.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_03": "There, you see? Take that tidbit as a token of my appreciation for your assistance. Perhaps working with others does have its merits.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_04": "For our next move, let\u2019s see how helpful these observations are in facing the power of Primal Reversion directly.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_02_sierra_05": "I believe I hear a telltale cry coming from that direction. Take your Pok\u00e9mon and challenge them for me, would you?",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_00": "%PLAYERNAME%! The strange weather seems to have subsided a little. Your attempts to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon are clearly paying off. Great work!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_01": "I take it your partnership with Team GO Rocket is going well.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_02": "It goes to show we can always find new friends, even in precarious times. But before I let you get back to it... Well. Keep your guard up.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_03": "I don\u2019t feel good taking Team GO Rocket\u2019s newfound helpfulness with such a large spoonful of skepticism, but I can\u2019t forget their past deeds so easily.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_04": "Until they give us cause for concern, though, I\u2019m thankful for their help.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_05": "But remember that even though you\u2019ve gathered some research material\u2014great snapshots, by the way\u2014we haven\u2019t managed to quell Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon for good.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_03_06": "I\u2019m off to check if Rhi and the team leaders have made any progress toward locating the Red and Blue Orbs. Keep at it, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_00": "Acceptable work. You\u2019ve actually managed to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_01": "And what do you have there? Let me see it.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_02": "This looks similar to Mega Energy. Could it be...nature\u2019s energy distilled?",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_03": "...",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_04": "Interesting. Fascinating, even. Now I have what I need. With this new power source, Team GO Rocket\u2014no, I, Arlo\u2014will be able to control the very shape of the earth.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_05": "But even without that power, there\u2019s one thing I can rid myself of right now.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_arlo_06": "You. Farewell, friend of Candela. This alliance is over.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_00": "You\u2019ve calmed Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon a few times now.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_01": "Not bad! I\u2019d promote you if you were on my team. I know good work when I see it.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_02": "In fact, I\u2019m getting the hang of it by watching you.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_03": "Which means Team GO Rocket\u2019s got no more use for you!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_04": "So long, \u201cpartner\u201d!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_05": "Don\u2019t tell me you thought we were all best buds now? Pfft... Hahaha!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_cliff_06": "Nothing will shake my loyalty to Team GO Rocket. And don\u2019t you forget it!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_00": "Truly impressive! You\u2019ve managed to calm Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon more than once now.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_01": "Watching you and your Pok\u00e9mon in action has been a joy. I\u2019ve learned ever so much.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_02": "In fact, I\u2019ve learned enough that Team GO Rocket no longer needs you to be part of this operation!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_03": "Oh, but where are my manners? I must thank you for showing us exactly how to take down Kyogre and Groudon.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_04": "Rest secure in the knowledge that you\u2019ve contributed to the glory of Team GO Rocket.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_05": "You didn\u2019t think this would last forever, did you? Oh, darling. Our alliance ends now.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_04_sierra_06": "Solitude is best, after all...",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_00": "%PLAYERNAME%! What just happened? I saw the Team GO Rocket leaders running off in a huff! And your Pok\u00e9mon look like they\u2019ve been through the wringer!",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_01": "*sigh* Let me guess. They tried to pull a fast one on us, didn\u2019t they?",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_02": "Not very smart of them to go toe-to-toe with you. I assume you taught them a lesson before they could complete their scheme. Tell me all about what happened.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_03": "... ... ...\nThey made your Pok\u00e9mon fight alone against Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon? And they were trying to harness the power of Primal Reversion for themselves?",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_04": "Thank goodness you didn\u2019t let that power fall into Team GO Rocket\u2019s hands. If they\u2019d gained the ability to reshape the world, who knows what they would\u2019ve done?",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_05": "Even with that disaster averted, Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon are no closer to calming down. We\u2019ll have to rely on the team leaders and Rhi to find the Red and Blue Orbs so we can resolve the situation for good.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_06": "All the same, I don\u2019t want to understate what you\u2019ve done here, %PLAYERNAME%! Working with Team GO Rocket must have made for one uneasy alliance.",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_07": "You have my thanks for a job well done. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be seeing you again soon.\n(But...where did all this natural energy come from in the first place?)",
  "go_tour_live_sr_dialog_05_arlo_defeat": "Tch... Don\u2019t think for a second that you\u2019ve seen the last of me.",

  "gofest2022_berlin_5_11": "Until I uncover a clue, let us turn our attention back to the subject of food.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_5_12": "Would it benefit us to feed Pheromosa, I wonder?",
  "gofest2022_berlin_5_13": "Perhaps the positive properties of this world\u2019s Poffins affect Ultra Beasts as well.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_5_14": "However, Pheromosa seems reticent to engage\u2014almost as if this world disagrees with its notion of cleanliness.",

  "gofest2022_berlin_5_4": "Let us rest, then.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_5_5": "Perhaps your Pok\u00e9mon is also in need of nourishment.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_5_6": "And while we are on the subject: what distinguishes Pok\u00e9mon food from human food?",
  "gofest2022_berlin_5_7": "Your professor would have such answers? I should have known\u2014his juice-stained coat speaks of an affinity for Berries.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_5_8": "Do you think he\u2014",
  "gofest2022_berlin_5_9": "Apologies. It was tactless of me to speak of Willow when you are anxious about his safety.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_6_1": "What an oddly enjoyable endeavor, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_6_10": "The more we learn, the less there is to fear.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_6_11": "I suspect Willow feels much the sa\u2014",
  "gofest2022_berlin_6_12": "Wait. Another anomaly is approaching. It almost resembles the description you gave of the Pok\u00e9mon Shaymin, and yet with marked differences...",
  "gofest2022_berlin_6_2": "Your Pok\u00e9mon are lucky to have such a reliable guardian.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_6_3": "I\u2019m sure they are grateful. As am I.",

  "gofest2022_berlin_7_3": "What a resplendent revelation.",
  "gofest2022_berlin_7_4": "You said Shaymin is drawn to gratitude. Do you believe it was my own such feelings that brought it here?",

  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_1": "Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pok\u00e9mon GO! My name is Willow. People call me the Pok\u00e9mon Prof!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_2": "This world is inhabited by creatures called Pok\u00e9mon! Some people keep Pok\u00e9mon as companions. Others have them do battle. Myself? I study Pok\u00e9mon as a profession.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_3": "Did that remind you of anyone? For many years, Trainers from Kanto have heard similar remarks before embarking on their journeys through the region.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_4": "I have the honor of making them today because you\u2019re about to head out on your own Kanto-inspired journey.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_1_5": "But we can\u2019t have you leaving unprepared! I\u2019ve put together some supplies I think you\u2019ll find useful.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_0": "Berries, Potions, and Pok\u00e9 Balls. Looks like you\u2019re all set!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_1": "As you begin today\u2019s adventure, try to imagine you\u2019re stepping straight into the tall grass of Kanto.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_2": "I have a feeling you\u2019ll meet a Pok\u00e9mon that will make a wonderful partner on your journey. Be sure to take some snapshots of the Pok\u00e9mon you encounter along the way!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_3": "On adventures, I find it\u2019s helpful to document not only your findings but also your memories. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make plenty of both!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_2_4": "Now, in the words of a wise professor: Your very own Pok\u00e9mon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Pok\u00e9mon awaits! Let's GO!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_0": "How\u2019s your journey going, %PLAYERNAME%? Oh! Found a partner Pok\u00e9mon to join you, eh? Wonderful work.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_1": "In the Kanto region, Trainers are often presented with three options when it comes to their first partner Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_2": "The first is Bulbasaur, the Seed Pok\u00e9mon, #001 in the Pok\u00e9dex. This Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon has a plant seed on its back right from the day it\u2019s born.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_3": "Another option is Charmander, the Lizard Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s a Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon, and it has a flame on its tail that shows the strength of its life force.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_4": "Last\u2014but certainly not least\u2014is Squirtle, the Tiny Turtle Pok\u00e9mon. After birth, this Water-type Pok\u00e9mon's back swells and hardens into a shell.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_5": "Each of these Pok\u00e9mon have their strengths and weaknesses, so be sure to study up! For now, though, it\u2019s time to get back to your adventure.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_6": "I\u2019d like you to spend some time with your buddy. The relationship between a Trainer and their Pok\u00e9mon is of utmost importance!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_3_7": "How about going on a walk together? I always enjoy exploring with my buddy!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_0": "Wonderful work, Trainer! Glad to see you\u2019re growing closer to your buddy. Keep it up, and you\u2019ll become even closer in no time.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_1": "When it comes to being a Trainer, people often talk about catching techniques or battle strategies, but I find that friendship is just as essential.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_2": "Not only are the relationships you build with your Pok\u00e9mon incredibly important, but so are the friendships you build with other Trainers.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_3": "Your personal journeys and goals may vary, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re all Trainers! You should do your best to connect with the other Trainers you meet on your travels.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_4_4": "In that spirit, how about sending your friends some Gifts to brighten their day? I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love to hear from you!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_0": "Welcome back, Trainer! Hope you enjoyed connecting with other Trainers. I see you were even able to trade a few Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_1": "Trading is a fabulous way to acquire Pok\u00e9mon you might not have otherwise encountered.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_2": "And not only do you get a new entry in your Pok\u00e9dex, but you also get a new friend!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_3": "You\u2019ve already made great progress on your journey. I think it\u2019s time to show off the skills you\u2019ve learned along the way!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_4": "How about showcasing your throwing expertise by catching some Pok\u00e9mon? Don\u2019t forget to make use of your Berries, too.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_5_5": "I\u2019m especially fond of Pinap Berries. They help you earn extra Candy for the Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019re catching\u2014and they\u2019re tasty to boot!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_0": "I\u2019m sure I had a stash of Pinap Berries here somewhere... Oh! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess my snack will have to wait.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_1": "I\u2019ve been checking up on your progress, and I have to say, I\u2019m very impressed! It seems there\u2019s no challenge you can\u2019t overcome.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_2": "As I\u2019m sure you know, a well-rounded Trainer needs to have a great team of Pok\u00e9mon to battle against other Trainers or even challenge Pok\u00e9mon in raids.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_3": "I think this is a great time to power up some of your Pok\u00e9mon and bolster your team.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_4": "While you focus on that, I\u2019ll be looking into an interesting rumor I caught wind of.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_5": "There have been reports of encounters with a Pok\u00e9mon that\u2019s able to transform into another Pok\u00e9mon entirely. Fascinating stuff!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_6_6": "I\u2019ll be sure to share whatever I find when you return.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_0": "Glad you\u2019re back, Trainer. After looking into those reports, it certainly sounds like the work of Ditto, the Transform Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_1": "Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other shapes. What an incredible Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_2": "However, there seems to be something more to this situation.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_3": "Could you help me with some research so we can find out what exactly is going on?",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_7_4": "I\u2019ll continue my work here to see if I can uncover some more information that might help us.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Is it true?! You encountered a Shiny Ditto?! I\u2019m stunned!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_1": "You\u2019ve had quite the journey, haven\u2019t you? It\u2019s been a joy to follow your progress, as always.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_2": "Believe it or not, though, there\u2019s still another mystery that needs solving.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_3": "You see, after looking over the research you\u2019ve conducted, I think we might be on the trail of the New Species Pok\u00e9mon, Mew.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_4": "We've documented Mew in the past, but something\u2019s different this time\u2014though I can\u2019t yet say what that is.",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_5": "Whatever the case, I think it\u2019s safe to say this is going to be a memorable adventure!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_6": "In the meantime, keep an eye out for another research assignment. I have a feeling this is going to be an especially challenging endeavor, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re up to it!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_7": "For now, though, I think congratulations are in order. You did a tremendous job on today\u2019s Kanto-themed journey!",
  "gotour_kanto_srd_dialogue_8_8": "I hope you were able to make some special memories with your Pok\u00e9mon and fellow Trainers. Thanks again for all your help and hard work!",

Game Specific Disclosures<br><br>Additional Privacy Information for Pok\u00e9mon GO<br><br>Pok\u00e9mon Trainer Club Accounts. You can sign up for Pok\u00e9mon GO using your third-party Pok\u00e9mon Trainer Club (\u201cPTC\u201d) account administered by The Pok\u00e9mon Company International (\u201cTPCI\u201d). If you choose to do so, we will collect from TPCI your PTC registered email address, your PTC username and a unique PTC user ID. If you are registering your PTC account on behalf of your authorized child we will also collect some Personal Data about your child. See the \u201cAccounts with Children\u201d paragraph below for more information.<br><br>Accounts with Children. We comply with parental consent requirements as mandated by the U.S. Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and European data protection laws (including, without limitation, the General Data Protection Regulation) through a verification and consent process handled by TPCI. As described in the Pok\u00e9mon GO Terms of Service, the parent or legal guardian (\u201cParent\u201d) of each child under the age of 13, or in the EEA 16 or the age needed to consent to the processing of personal data (\u201cChild\u201d), must register with TPCI through a PTC account before their Child can access and use the game. The Parent will have to provide to TPCI certain Personal Data about the Child in accordance with the TPCI privacy policy. Of that, Niantic will only collect from TPCI the Child\u2019s personal email address, and the date when the Child will grow out of the age limits listed above.<br><br>For U.S. residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent\u2019s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent\u2019s social security number and the Parent\u2019s name, date of birth, and street address. TPCI will not share that information with us. After TPCI verifies the Parent\u2019s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pok\u00e9mon GO. If a Parent does not consent to a Child\u2019s access to and use of Pok\u00e9mon GO or does not verify their identity through the consent process, Niantic will bar that Child\u2019s registration on Pok\u00e9mon GO and prevent the Child\u2019s access to and use of the game.<br><br>Parents have the right to refuse further collection, use, and/or disclosure of their Child\u2019s Personal Data by notifying us. As a Parent, you understand that Niantic has a legitimate interest in providing your Child\u2019s information collected via the Services to third party providers for the sole purpose of administering or providing the Services, as described in Paragraph 3 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>Information shared with other players. When you take certain actions in Pok\u00e9mon GO and capture a Gym, your (or your authorized Child\u2019s) username will be shared publicly through the game, including with other players, in connection with that Gym location.<br><br>Apple Watch and Apple Health App Data. If you use Pok\u00e9mon GO with your Apple Watch, with your consent we use the Apple HealthKit APIs to read and/or write certain data about your fitness activity (Step Count, Calories Burned, and Distance Walked) to the Health App Database on your device (the \u201cHealth App Data\u201d).   We may store Health App Data on our servers in connection with your Pok\u00e9mon GO user account.   We use Health App Data to provide you certain functionality in the game (such as distances walked to hatch Eggs), and to ensure you get \u201ccredit\u201d in your Apple Health App for all of the walking you do while playing Pok\u00e9mon GO.  We will not use Health App Data for marketing or advertising purposes.  We do not store Health App Data in iCloud.  Pok\u00e9mon GO cannot read from or write to the Health App Database without your consent.<br>Additional Privacy Information for Ingress<br><br>Information shared publicly. When you play Ingress, as part of the gameplay the following information about you will be shared through the game (including with other players directly within the app, in game notifications emailed to other players as part of the gameplay, and online on the Ingress Intel Map website), and will therefore become publicly available: your in-game username, messages sent to other users in COMMS, and in-game portals that you interact with, as well as your device location whenever you take an in-game action.<br>",

  "quest_dialogue_genesect_2_0": "Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve been on fire when it comes to getting these research tasks done! Get it? You\u2019re on fire?",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_2_1": "Anyway...the damage can\u2019t have been caused by a Trainer Battle. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before. It seems almost...unnatural?",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_2_2": "Could it really have been caused by Pok\u00e9mon? This is getting fascinating! Could you do some research on Water-type Pok\u00e9mon for me?",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_2_3": "As I followed the damage trail further, the burned area suddenly ended and strange water damage started appearing, and it just doesn\u2019t seem to line up with any Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve encountered.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back! We might have stumbled upon something incredible.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_1": "I contacted one of my colleagues in the Unova region.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_2": "She shared some notes about a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon called Genesect that was restored from a 300-million-year-old fossil and then altered.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_3": "Pretty cool, huh? The notes say that though this Pok\u00e9mon is Bug and Steel type, it\u2019s known to be able to use attacks with types like Fire and Water, among others.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_4": "This lines up with the damage at the site we\u2019ve been researching!",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_5": "One of the other types Genesect can attack with is Electric, and as I kept following the damage trail, I found spots that must have been hit by some kind of high-voltage Electric-type attack.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_3_6": "I\u2019ll see if anything else lies even farther down the trail, but in the meantime, I know I can count on you to start investigating Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon to help us get to the bottom of this.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_0": "I can\u2019t thank you enough for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. You really are my Special Research good-luck charm!",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_1": "With the information you collected combined with the notes from Unova, I think we\u2019ve uncovered the Bug- and Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon Genesect!",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_2": "I know what you\u2019re thinking: Bug AND Steel with such odd attack types?",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_3": "Apparently, when this Pok\u00e9mon is holding a specially developed item called a Drive, its Techno Blast attack changes to a type that corresponds to the Drive the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s holding.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_4": "I wonder what kinds of Drives exist for this Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_5": "I still have so many questions, but for now, why not do a little research on Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon? I hear Ice is another type Genesect can wield.",
  "quest_dialogue_genesect_4_6": "You ought to take a snapshot of Genesect to commemorate your meeting, too!",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Good to see you again. Your research inspired me to do some more research of my own, and I think I\u2019ve come across something...groundbreaking.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_0_1": "I was investigating the digging patterns of Diglett, and I wound up heading deep into a cave. Inside, I came across some unusual markings carved heavily into the cavern walls.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_0_2": "At first, I thought them to be random, but then I realized the carvings formed four unique patterns, each consisting of seven circles.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_0_3": "These patterns look incredibly familiar, and I think we need to take a closer look at some Pok\u00e9mon in particular.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_0_4": "Can I count on you to help me research some Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon?  I have a hunch that this will lead us to our first clue.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_1_0": "Simply amazing! The pattern on the Regirock you caught matches perfectly with the first pattern of carvings on the cave walls.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_1_1": "This leads me to believe we should move our investigation to Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon. I wonder if we\u2019ll find another Pok\u00e9mon that will help us solve this puzzle.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_1_2": "I have one in mind, but I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself!",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_1_3": "I\u2019m sure with the help of an accomplished Trainer such as yourself, we\u2019ll be on our way to figuring this out in no time.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_2_0": "As expected, Regice clearly has similar markings to the second carving I found in the cave.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_2_1": "I remember an ancient legend that told a story about a Colossal Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s said that it made Pok\u00e9mon that looked like itself from a special ice mountain, rocks, and magma.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_2_2": "Could it be these Pok\u00e9mon these patterns originate from? This is starting to get exciting, isn\u2019t it?",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_2_3": "If the first two Pok\u00e9mon were Regirock and Regice...then there\u2019s only one left that we must research further.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_3_0": "Excellent work. I believe we\u2019re going in the right direction. This could only mean one thing, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_3_1": "We\u2019re close to coming across the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Regigigas! According to legend, this Pok\u00e9mon towed continents with rope.",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_3_2": "Maybe it can help move my research lab next time it gets stuck. Hahaha!",
  "quest_dialogue_gigas_3_3": "Anyway...I have a feeling that once you fully document these amazing creatures, you\u2019ll make a colossal discovery of your own.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_0": "Welcome to GO Fest 2019, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_1": "I discovered something fascinating during my research, and I need your help. I\u2019ve come across what I believe to be a rare Pok\u00e9mon deep in slumber.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_2": "We have our work cut out for us, %PLAYERNAME%. I think this adventure is going to call for some resources and even the help of some friends.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_0_3": "Could you collect some supplies? Meanwhile, I\u2019ll see if I can find anything about this Pok\u00e9mon in any of my texts.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_0": "Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m sure the resources you\u2019ve earned will be crucial.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_1": "I had some success in my research, as well. I came across an ancient text containing the story of a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon that grants wishes.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_2": "I\u2019m still researching the best way to awaken this Pok\u00e9mon, but I keep hearing reports of other Pok\u00e9mon in the area showing signs of distress.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_1_3": "Could I ask you to investigate these reports?",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew I could count on you. You know, something interesting came up when I reviewed your results.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_1": "Many of the Pok\u00e9mon you encountered seem to have strayed from their habitats.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_2": "I\u2019d like you to help them get back to their proper habitats, as I\u2019m sure this will soothe them and make them more comfortable. This should be a breeze for an accomplished Trainer like you!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_2_3": "As you return the Pok\u00e9mon to their proper habitats, be sure to snap pictures to help document this unusual situation.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019re certainly getting the hang of that camera! Did you notice anything strange while taking photos of Pok\u00e9mon in their habitats?",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_1": "Apparently there\u2019s an unusual phenomenon where Pok\u00e9mon leap out in an attempt to appear in your photos. I\u2019ve heard Spark refer to it as a \u201cphotobomb.\u201d",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_2": "I\u2019m eternally amused\u2014and amazed\u2014by the things we learn about Pok\u00e9mon every day. That said, I did notice a connection.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_3": "These Pok\u00e9mon all seem to have something in common\u2014music! I have a hunch that music may be the key to awakening our slumbering Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_3_4": "What do you think, %PLAYERNAME%? Shall we set the stage and see if some beautiful music is the answer to this perplexing situation?",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_0": "That\u2019s it! The pure melody created by your musical Pok\u00e9mon has awakened the Steel- and Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon Jirachi!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_1": "The ancient text was right\u2014this Mythical Pok\u00e9mon could only be awakened from its thousand-year slumber by a song of purity. The text also says that when Jirachi awakens, it grants wishes!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_2": "Now that we\u2019ve done the work of waking Jirachi up, I wonder what you and your fellow Trainers will wish for. I already know what my wish is going to be\u2014I want you to enjoy this amazing experience!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_3": "It isn\u2019t every day that you get to join Trainers from all over the world in exploring a park with so many Pok\u00e9mon in such diverse habitats\u2014not to mention meeting a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_4_4": "I\u2019m sure Jirachi was far from the last amazing discovery to be made, though. I\u2019ll no doubt be calling on your excellent research skills again in the future!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_0": "Nice to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m excited to get started on our next big adventure.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_1": "What do we need to do? Well, I\u2019ve come across something amazing, and I need your help.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_2": "We\u2019re going to focus our efforts on Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Hoenn region, because I have some leads on a Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve never seen before!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_3": "First, we need to get some baseline research to help track this Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_0_4": "Can you explore the area? Who knows\u2014you might make some friends along the way.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_0": "Great job, Trainer. Your work helped me get a better understanding of the search area for this mysterious Pok\u00e9mon. I can\u2019t wait to show you what I\u2019ve been working on.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_1": "A few weeks ago, I came across an ancient text that was found in the Hoenn region. It was filled with fascinating information.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_2": "It mentions a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon that awakens once every thousand years and has the ability to grant wishes!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_1_3": "I really want to get a deeper understanding of this text, and how better to do that than with some research? Can you help me collect some information on Pok\u00e9mon from the Hoenn region?",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_0": "Thanks for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Hoenn Pok\u00e9dex is really looking great!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_1": "The Whismur you caught reminded me of a line from the text I told you about. It mentioned that a melody or a sound can awaken a sleeping Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_2": "That gives me an idea... Let\u2019s do a little experiment. There\u2019s a sleeping Snorlax that hasn\u2019t left my lab in months. And it\u2019s right in front of my Berry stash!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_2_3": "Think we could wake it up with a loud noise? Let\u2019s document the Whismur Evolution line, too\u2014some photos will do.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_0": "Wow! That sure was loud, but it did the trick! Loudred worked just like an alarm clock for poor Snorlax.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_1": "I should make up for the rude awakening with some Berries... Well, we\u2019ve learned something important here, and I think this method could work to awaken even the deepest of sleepers.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_2": "If my calculations are correct, the wish-granting Mythical Pok\u00e9mon might be ready to awaken soon, and we should be prepared to do the waking!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_3": "The text says that the Pok\u00e9mon is a Steel and Psychic type, so I think a good next step is to catch a few Pok\u00e9mon with similar characteristics.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_3_4": "We\u2019ll need a few extra hands to get this done, too. Could you get some fellow Trainers to help out?",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_0": "Good work, %PLAYERNAME%. With the help of your research, I\u2019ve been able to decipher more of this ancient text.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_1": "It says that when the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon awakens, it will grant any wishes written on notes attached to its head.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_2": "Another interesting tidbit: If this Pok\u00e9mon senses danger, it will fight without awakening. Up for a Trainer Battle, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_4_3": "If the battle causes any reactions nearby, I have sensors set up to detect them. It might seem like a long shot, but I have a good feeling about this!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_0": "It worked! I\u2019m picking up some vibrations nearby. I think we\u2019re on the right track.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_1": "Maybe the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon is close to awakening. Since what we\u2019re doing is working, let\u2019s keep it up.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_2": "We need to pull out all the stops, though, and the timing has to be just right.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_3": "I\u2019ll hold things down here with Loudred while you keep focusing on encountering Steel- and Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_5_4": "If you can do that, I think it\u2019ll help the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon see that you\u2019re a worthy Trainer!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_0": "Simply astonishing! We encountered the Steel- and Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon Jirachi!",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_1": "That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Well, once in several lifetimes, if Jirachi truly only wakes once every thousand years.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_2": "You\u2019ve become such an accomplished Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%. Thank you for going on this amazing adventure with me.",
  "quest_dialogue_jirachi_global_6_3": "You can bet I\u2019ll be in touch whenever another exciting research project comes up. Until then, let\u2019s get out there and GO!",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_0_0": "Well, well! If it isn\u2019t my favorite research assistant!",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_0_1": "Your timing couldn\u2019t be better. I had a meeting with Silph Co. the other day where they asked for help catching a large number of Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_0_2": "Seeing as you\u2019re already here, would you mind lending a hand?",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_0_3": "...Great! I knew I could count on you, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll check in with you again soon.",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_1_0": "Incredible, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_1_1": "Keep it up\u2014I suspect your efforts will be well rewarded.",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_0": "Amazing job, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_1": "As a thank-you for your dedication, Silph Co. is offering to send over one of their most valuable inventions: a Master Ball!",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_2": "As you may already know, a Master Ball is no ordinary Pok\u00e9 Ball. With it, you can catch any wild Pok\u00e9mon without fail.",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_3": "Now that\u2019s what I call a scientific marvel!",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_4": "An opportunity like this doesn\u2019t come around often. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ll be the one to seize it.",
  "quest_dialogue_season12_masterball_2_5": "You\u2019re almost to the finish line, %PLAYERNAME%. Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_dialogue_thanks_0": "How was 2019 for you, %PLAYERNAME%? For me, it was a fantastic year, and I want to thank you and all our Trainers around the world for your hard work.",
  "quest_dialogue_thanks_1": "Together, we took on Team GO Rocket, uncovered the Wish Pok\u00e9mon, Jirachi, and began encountering Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in Unova.",
  "quest_dialogue_thanks_2": "I want to make sure you know how proud I am of how much you and all the other Trainers have grown this last year!",
  "quest_dialogue_thanks_3": "And now with 2020 on the horizon, there are sure to be many more adventures awaiting! Until then, let\u2019s get up and GO!",
  "quest_dialogue_winterwishes23_0_0": "Brr... Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you\u2019re keeping warm out there.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_11": "What a confusing but educational day this has been, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed the Transform Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s shenanigans! Now, until next time, ... ... ...!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_2": "Er...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_3": "%PLAYERNAME%? Is it really you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_4": "Oh, thank goodness. I\u2019ve had the most befuddling day.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_5": "The Pok\u00e9mon in the area were behaving strangely, so, as always, I turned to you to help me find out why\u2014but to my confusion, you just stared at me blankly and bit straight into a Nanab Berry!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_6": "The next thing I knew, \u201cyou\u201d had transformed into a Ditto! Or perhaps I have that backwards? Whatever the case, it seems that all the oddly behaving Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve seen today were in fact Ditto in disguise.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_7": "Hm? You noticed it too, did you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_8": "And you saw a Ditto that had transformed to look like me? Incredible!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_af2022_2_9": "As you\u2019ve experienced, Ditto have the fascinating ability to reconstitute their entire cellular structure to transform into whatever they see.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s...it\u2019s...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_1": "It\u2019s the Pidgey! They\u2019ve flown the coop!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_2": "For years, Trainers like yourself have been sending me Pidgey to research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_3": "I\u2019ve kept each and every one safe and healthy, feeding them the best Berries, providing them with the softest nests...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_4": "But somehow they\u2019ve escaped from my lab! Maybe this is what I get for using a Great Fence instead of an Ultra Fence.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_5": "*sigh* And after all the care I put into everyone\u2019s Pidgey, too. We\u2019ve got a real whirlwind of a situation on our hands!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_6": "On the bright side, this might make for a fascinating paper on the impact of the flighty flock on the local environment...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_0_7": "But first things first. Help me catch as many of these plucky Pidgey as you can, %PLAYERNAME%! Before they try to fly off with my whole trailer...or me!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_0": "%PLAYERNAME%? %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_1": "Phew! I was worried the Pidgey might\u2019ve blown you away.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_2": "Most of the Pidgey are back safe in the lab, thanks to you and your fellow Trainers! I\u2019m so glad it wasn\u2019t a gust\u2014er, bust.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_3": "Take these items for your help with today\u2019s feathery fracas, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_4": "I\u2019ve put in an order for double the Pidgey\u2019s usual amount of Berries, so let's hope they\u2019ll feel pampered enough not to be a flight risk anymore.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_afools_1_5": "That\u2019s enough fun for one day, I\u2019d say. Until next time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Isn\u2019t it lovely out?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_1": "There are Litten lying in the sun, Rowlet relaxing in the trees, Popplio playing in the water\u2014and these malasadas Spark dropped off sure are delicious!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_2": "It seems even the flowers smell sweeter today!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_3": "Why don\u2019t you go out and see what Pok\u00e9mon are around, %PLAYERNAME%? Maybe we\u2019ll find something new to research!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_0_4": "I think I\u2019ll sit this one out. Taking breaks is important!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_0": "Ah, you\u2019re back already, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014and with some new Pok\u00e9mon in tow! Well done.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_1": "While you were gone, I noticed there\u2019s something sparkling in the air today. Perhaps it\u2019s a result of my radiant personality, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_2": "Haha! Seriously though, it\u2019s something I\u2019m looking into.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_3": "For now, let\u2019s have a look at the Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve caught.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_4": "Hmm, how curious. You appear to have caught several Pok\u00e9mon that are often found on Alola\u2019s Akala Island.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_5": "Akala Island has some amazing geographical features that make it a suitable habitat for a wide range of Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_6": "There\u2019s Brooklet Hill, a fantastic fishing spot with a series of cascading waterfalls. And Lush Jungle, where trees grow densely together, as well as Wela Volcano Park\u2014which, as you may have guessed, is a volcano!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_1_7": "How about keeping an eye out for Fire-, Water-, and Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon while you\u2019re out, %PLAYERNAME%? If my hunch is correct, you may run into more Pok\u00e9mon often seen about Akala Island.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! That\u2019s quite an assortment of Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve encountered.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_1": "I wish I\u2019d been out there with you, but I wasn\u2019t sitting idly by! I think I may have discovered why the air seems to be sparkling today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_2": "You see, Blanche just reported witnessing a mysterious pink Pok\u00e9mon behind a flower bush.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_3": "Based on its description, I believe Blanche may have seen Tapu Lele, the guardian deity of Akala Island.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_4": "The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of Tapu Lele\u2019s energy. Perhaps that has something to do with why the flowers smell so sweet today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_2_5": "Spark and Blanche have both seen guardian deities now... Hmm. While I chew on that, let\u2019s get out and look for Tapu Lele, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_0": "Whew! That was a good walk. I just got back myself, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_1": "I wasn\u2019t able to find Tapu Lele, but I did manage to get a closer look at some of the sparkles I\u2019ve been seeing in the air.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_2": "They appear to be the glowing scales Tapu Lele is known to scatter. Touching them is said to restore good health on the spot.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_3": "How did you fare during your investigation, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_4": "*gasp* You saw Tapu Lele?! That\u2019s incredible!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_5": "So, we\u2019ve been visited by two of Alola\u2019s guardian deities now... What could they be here for, I wonder?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_6": "Tapu Lele is said to be guilelessly cruel, so I do hope we\u2019re staying on its good side.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_7": "If I could just meet one of the guardian deities myself, it would help me form a solid hypothesis as to why they\u2019re appearing...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_akala_3_8": "But that\u2019s for me to ponder. Don\u2019t trouble yourself with it\u2014go out and enjoy the day! I\u2019ll be in touch soon. Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Wonderful to see you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_1": "You may know this already, but some Pok\u00e9mon have different forms depending on the region they appear in, like Geodude. In most places, Geodude are described as being very similar to rocks\u2014so much so that many Trainers mistake them for boulders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_2": "Uniquely, the Geodude found in Alola are Rock- and Electric-type, while the Geodude found in Kanto are Rock- and Ground-type. Fascinating, don't you think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_3": "You know, if you accidentally step on an Alolan Geodude, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_4": "I\u2019d read about this phenomenon some time ago, but I was, er, \u201clucky\u201d enough to experience it myself earlier today. Suffice it to say it left me feeling electrified!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_0_5": "Why don\u2019t you head out to find some Alolan Geodude for yourself? Just make sure to watch your step!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you had no trouble finding Alolan Geodude.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_1": "When Alolan Geodude evolves into Alolan Graveler, it becomes even more impressive. Alolan Graveler\u2019s food of choice is a mineral called dravite. After eating it, crystals form inside the Pok\u00e9mon, rising to the surface in some parts of its body.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_2": "Oh! And this fact\u2019s my favorite: When two Alolan Graveler clash, it fills the surrounding area with flashes of light and sound. People call it the \u201cfireworks of the earth\u201d!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_1_3": "You know, I\u2019d really like to see Alolan Graveler for myself. Think you can help me out, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_0": "Well done! That\u2019s a mighty Alolan Graveler you\u2019ve got there.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_1": "I\u2019d love to see those \u201cfireworks of the earth\u201d for myself, but...maybe later. And much farther from my lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_2": "In any case! While you were away, I continued with some field research of my own. I saw the most curious thing\u2014an Alolan Geodude flying through the air!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_3": "I suspect it was the work of Alolan Golem, the Evolution of Alolan Graveler. Alolan Golem can shoot large rocks that are charged with electricity. However, because it can\u2019t fire boulders at a rapid pace, it\u2019s been known to grab nearby Geodude and fire them instead.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_2_4": "Can you do some research to help me understand what I saw?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_0": "Ah, you\u2019re back\u2014and with an Alolan Golem!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_1": "Alolan Golem are known to be grumpy and stubborn. If you upset them, they discharge electricity from the surface of their bodies and let out a growl that sounds like thunder.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_2": "Between that and their penchant for launching Geodude in lieu of boulders, we\u2019d best be careful around Alolan Golem.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_3": "You have an incredible knack for befriending Pok\u00e9mon, though, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be the best of pals in no time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_alodude_3_4": "Thanks for assisting me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. It always \u201crocks\u201d to have your help! Heh heh... See you next time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_0_0": "Good to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. Have you noticed an increased number of Abra in the area?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_0_1": "Yes, so did I. I originally thought this strange phenomenon was happening due to Abra\u2019s ability to teleport.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_0_2": "When Abra decides to teleport randomly, it creates the illusion that it\u2019s made copies of itself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_0_3": "However, what\u2019s happening right now really does seem to be a large number of Abra appearing in the wild! Let\u2019s research more about Abra and see what we can discover about the Psi Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_1_0": "Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Are you having difficulty catching Abra you encounter?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_1_1": "It\u2019s said that you must clear your mind if you want to catch an Abra.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_1_2": "Or maybe you could ask your buddy for some catching assistance!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_1_3": "I\u2019ve got a few more things about Abra that I could use your help researching. How about you give me a hand, and I\u2019ll see if I can find a nice treat for your buddy?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_2_0": "I\u2019m sure your buddy appreciates that delicious Poffin! I\u2019m more of a Pinap Berry man myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_2_1": "While researching Abra, I read that it can sense danger and maintains a telepathic radar even while it\u2019s sleeping! What amazing abilities!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_2_2": "Why don\u2019t you keep researching? As a token of my thanks, I\u2019ll give you one of the Rocket Radars I\u2019ve developed.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_2_3": "While it won\u2019t give you Abra\u2019s ability to sense danger while sleeping, it will help you track down any trouble the Team GO Rocket Leaders are stirring up.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_3_0": "Thank you again, %PLAYERNAME%, for all your help today. It was incredible researching Abra with you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_3_1": "We learned so much about this Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon. Rumor has it that some lucky Trainers even encountered Shiny Abra in the wild!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_3_2": "Pok\u00e9mon are truly amazing creatures. There\u2019s always something to discover.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_at_3_3": "Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019ve got something for you to sink your teeth into.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_1": "Have you noticed the peculiar marks on the trees and boulders in the area? And the crushed berries on the ground?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_2": "While I\u2019m a little disappointed in today\u2019s Pinap Berry harvest, I\u2019ve got a feeling that a Pok\u00e9mon is responsible\u2014and that means we have something to research!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_3": "And I\u2019ll bet you even have an idea what Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019ll be investigating!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_0_4": "Why don\u2019t you search the area and let me know what you find?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_1": "Aha! So Axew are responsible for those unique marks and crushed berries.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_2": "These Pok\u00e9mon play with each other by knocking their large tusks together. Crushing berries is how they test each other\u2019s strength.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_3": "Axew tusks are sharp enough that people long ago used them as cooking knives!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_4": "These Pok\u00e9mon find culinary uses for their tusks in the wild, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_5": "Fraxure, Axew\u2019s Evolution, uses its thick tusks to neatly cut prey into two portions\u2014one to eat now and one to save for later.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_6": "Fascinating, isn\u2019t it? I wish I had that kind of restraint!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_1_7": "Why don\u2019t you try evolving one of your Axew? Maybe I can get some tips for my meal prepping!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_0": "Look at this fine Fraxure, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_1": "Now that you\u2019ve got one of your own, here are a few more Fraxure facts.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_2": "Their territory battles can be intensely violent, and their tusks can shatter rocks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_3": "But the tusks don\u2019t grow back once they break, so Fraxure won\u2019t use them unless truly necessary.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_4": "Even so, getting up close to one has me on edge\u2014not unlike the sharp edges of their tusks!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_5": "Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_6": "No? Ah well. So much for my sharp wit.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_7": "Anyway, it\u2019s a good thing that Haxorus, Fraxure\u2019s Evolution, has a kind disposition.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_2_8": "Why don\u2019t you evolve Fraxure so we can see for ourselves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_0": "Your Haxorus\u2019s tusks are positively gleaming!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_1": "Or should I say beaming? Those sturdy tusks can cut steel beams and stay sharp! Haxorus are covered in great armor, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_2": "They\u2019re docile, but they\u2019ll become incredibly angry if their tusks are touched. Understandable\u2014both Pok\u00e9mon and people have different sensitivities.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_3": "Some of us are huggers, like me and Spark! But Blanche, ah, isn\u2019t.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_4": "Nothing\u2019s wrong with either, of course! It\u2019s all part of what makes each person, and Pok\u00e9mon, unique.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_axew_3_5": "Thanks for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll see you again soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_0": "Hmm, I see... And then... Mm-hmm... Oh! Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_1": "I was totally absorbed in my investigation of a most curious phenomenon in the area. Maybe you\u2019ve noticed it yourself?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_2": "You know\u2014the large boulders all over and the pieces of rock that look like they were broken off?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_3": "Perhaps you can help put some fire to all the smoke. Would you mind canvassing the area and letting me know if you find anything noteworthy?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_0": "Aha! Looks like Bagon, the Rock Head Pok\u00e9mon, is responsible for the recent rocky wreckage.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_1": "Bagon aspire to one day soar through the sky. As if trying to dispel their frustration over their inability to do so, they slam their hard heads against huge rocks, shattering them into pebbles.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_2": "In fact, there are some theories that suggest this head-bashing behavior stimulates cells that affect their evolution!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_3": "Fascinating, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s test the theories out and evolve a Bagon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_0": "And what have we here, %PLAYERNAME%? Well, well, it\u2019s Shelgon, the Endurance Pok\u00e9mon! Excellent work.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_1": "Shelgon\u2019s shell is iron-hard and repels enemy attacks. When it\u2019s waiting to evolve, it often hides away in a cavern.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_2": "And while it\u2019s shut up in its shell, I hear it still dreams of the day it\u2019ll be able to fly.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_3": "Why don\u2019t we give your Shelgon a helping hand to see what new heights\u2014literally\u2014it can reach?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_0": "Impressive! You helped Shelgon\u2019s dreams come true!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_1": "Salamence are overjoyed that they can finally take wing. They fly all over the place and usually don\u2019t land until they\u2019re completely exhausted and need to sleep.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_2": "I must say, this does open up all kinds of questions about what else Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon are capable of. It\u2019s really inspiring.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_3": "And while I don\u2019t recommend you bang your head into rocks to make your dreams come true, I\u2019m sure the sky\u2019s the limit for you too, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_battle_weekend_1_0": "Where will you focus your efforts, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_0": "Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you happened to do any exploring today?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_1": "It\u2019s quite the sight, let me tell you! It\u2019s lousy with Bellsprout out there!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_2": "They tend to prefer hot and humid places, but right now they seem to be everywhere.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_3": "And you know, there\u2019s still plenty for us to learn about the Flower Pok\u00e9mon. Would you be a pal and catch one for us to study?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. And what a great specimen you\u2019ve brought!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_1": "Did you know that despite their slender frames, they can move lightning fast to catch insects? One more reason to be glad we\u2019re not bugs!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_2": "But there\u2019s more for us to learn about this fascinating Pok\u00e9mon! Drop by again after you\u2019ve evolved your Bellsprout into Weepinbell.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_3": "I\u2019ll leaf through my Weepinbell research notes so I\u2019m ready for you when you get back!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_0": "Hey now, that\u2019s got to be the Weepinbell of the ball! Let me take a closer look.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_1": "Aha! You see that large hook on its rear end? Weepinbell tend to use that to hook themselves on tree branches when they sleep.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_2": "In other words, if you see your Weepinbell yawning, find it a tree on the double!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_3": "But there\u2019s no time for us to be snoozing. How about you evolve Weepinbell into a Victreebel and bring it back here?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_0": "Hey, you\u2019re victree-orious! Vic-tree...riffic? Ahem. Let\u2019s have a look at your Victreebell, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_1": "These large, plant-like Pok\u00e9mon live in huge colonies, deep within the jungle. No one who\u2019s visited has returned to tell the tale. That\u2019s sure foreboding!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_2": "Although if I put my professor cap on and think about it, how do we know about the colonies unless someone DID make it back?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_3": "There\u2019s something to ponder! In the meantime, thanks for letting me observe your Victreebel. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fast friends in no time\u2014just watch out for that prey-dissolving acid!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Just who I wanted to see. I just received a unique research request regarding a particular Pok\u00e9mon, and I think you\u2019re the perfect Trainer to help me with it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_0_1": "Let\u2019s warm up with a few tasks first, and then we can dive into the meat of it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer. I have a few more details to share about the research request I received.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_1": "A favorite of new and experienced Trainers alike, Bidoof, the Plump Mouse Pok\u00e9mon, has been appearing more often of late. Intriguing, no?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_2": "Now, before we continue, I have a very important choice for you to make. Will you focus your research on Bidoof or the Plump Mouse Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1_3": "Is this a trick question? Who could say! My only advice is to follow your heart. Besides, it\u2019s hard to go wrong when Bidoof is your only option!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_0": "Great choice, Trainer! For some reason, I just knew you\u2019d pick Bidoof. Don\u2019t ask me how!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_1": "Bidoof is known for its two large front teeth. Much like Rattata\u2019s teeth, Bidoof\u2019s teeth are continually growing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1a_2": "Speaking of teeth, I have a few tasks that you can sink yours into now!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_0": "Wonderful choice, Trainer! I had a feeling you\u2019d pick the Plump Mouse Pok\u00e9mon. Don\u2019t ask me why!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_1b_1": "Otherwise known as Bidoof, this Normal-type Pok\u00e9mon is far from ordinary! While only about a foot tall, Bidoof is powerful. It can chew through boulders with its incisors\u2014a feat that makes my jaw hurt to even think about.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Hopefully you got a few good snapshots of Bidoof while conducting your research! I always enjoy seeing the snapshots Trainers take of Pok\u00e9mon, and I can never get enough of Bidoof!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_1": "Now\u2014according to the research request we received, we must choose to focus our efforts on a Pok\u00e9mon that has nerves of steel or a Pok\u00e9mon that nests alongside water.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2_2": "I know what you\u2019re thinking: choosing between Bidoof and Bidoof isn\u2019t easy. But, then again, the most important research rarely is!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_1": "Bidoof isn\u2019t just cute to look at\u2014it\u2019s more agile and active than it appears! Nothing can perturb it, making it an excellent member of your team.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2a_2": "I think we could all learn from that steadiness. Channel your inner Bidoof so you can steel your nerves, too!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_2b_1": "Bidoof often live in groups by the water where they make their nests. I recall that Bibarel, Bidoof\u2019s Evolution, makes its nest by damming streams with bark and mud.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_0": "Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%, for assisting me with this special assignment. I think we all learned that there\u2019s more than meets the eye when it comes to Pok\u00e9mon\u2014especially Bidoof!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_1": "As a thank-you for your hard work, the team leaders and I prepared a gift for you to help show the world your love and knowledge of the indelible Bidoof. I hope you wear it with the pride it deserves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bidoof_branch_quest_3_2": "Why don\u2019t you put it on and enjoy a nice walk with your Bidoof? You never know what you might discover! Now, let\u2019s GO!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_0_6": "Professor Willow suggested you check on me? Well, I appreciate the thought, but it\u2019s quite unnecessary.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_0": "Hm? I\u2019m certain these Pinap Berries weren\u2019t here earlier. And you\u2019ve returned, %PLAYERNAME%? Then I suppose this was your doing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_1": "You didn\u2019t need to trouble yourself, but this does take one thing off my to-do list. Curious about how I\u2019ll use them?",

  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_3": "I\u2019m currently investigating whether feeding a Pok\u00e9mon various Berries immediately prior to it evolving has any influence on its physiology.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_1_4": "Speaking of which, the next step of this project is to see a Pok\u00e9mon evolve. I\u2019ll need to be on my way so I can locate one that\u2019s ready.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_0": "Did it occur to you to evolve your Pok\u00e9mon because of what I said earlier, %PLAYERNAME%? Thank you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_1": "You\u2019ve saved me quite a bit of time. I now have just about everything I need to get back on track.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_2": "The end goal of my research? To learn more about Pok\u00e9mon, of course. There\u2019s no end to that endeavor, as Professor Willow might say.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_3": "On a personal level, I\u2019d be satisfied if my research led to more insight on Lapras.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_4": "Lapras are able to understand human speech and are very intelligent. Their intellect and good nature are why I have one as my partner Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_5": "Yet to the best of our knowledge, they do not evolve. I\u2019d like to understand why.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_6": "I\u2019ve been working on hypotheses as to why some Pok\u00e9mon are able to evolve while others are not, but that is a far longer-term project.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_2_7": "Perhaps I speak from a place of bias, but I think you\u2019d do well to have a Lapras accompany you on your travels too, %PLAYERNAME%.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_3_1": "Thanks to your timely assistance, I can share my report far earlier than I initially anticipated.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_3_2": "You\u2019ve shown me today why Professor Willow always calls you his hero.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_blanche_apr23_3_3": "You\u2019re an observant friend and Trainer who has a knack for sensing when others are in need, even if they don\u2019t see it themselves.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_1": "Go ahead and take a deep breath in! Smell that sweet scent wafting in the air?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_2": "There\u2019s no deceiving a Pok\u00e9mon Professor\u2019s nose! That lovely aroma\u2019s all the proof we need that the Grass-type Bounsweet must be nearby. And in great numbers, by the scent of it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_0_3": "Now go on, follow your nose! Try and bring a Bounsweet back so we can study it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_0": "I\u2019d recognize that smell of success a mile away, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve happened on a bounty of Bounsweet!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_1": "Here\u2019s a fact: we\u2019re not the only ones interested in Bounsweet. Bird Pok\u00e9mon are always after them, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_2": "One fact isn\u2019t enough for you? Well, did you know that Bounsweet secrete a sweet\u2014and delicious\u2014sweat? Now you do! I sure wish I smelled that good!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_1_3": "Ahem. In any event, why don\u2019t you head out and catch some more so we can keep our sweet new friends safe?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_1": "Now that we\u2019re acquainted with the delightful Bounsweet, let\u2019s familiarize ourselves with its Evolution, Steenee.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_2": "Keep a sharp eye out for a Steenee performing its signature twirl. When they spin like that, they\u2019re spreading their amazing scent far and wide.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_2_3": "Just a whiff will give you a surge of happiness, in fact. So what are you waiting for, %PLAYERNAME%? We\u2019ve got joy to...well, enjoy!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_0": "Wow! What an impressive Tsareena!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_1": "But make sure you keep your guard up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_2": "Tsareena\u2019s kick can hit hard enough to take out even the toughest kickboxing champ.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bounsweet_3_3": "Anyhow, thanks for all the assists today, %PLAYERNAME%. Stay sharp and keep well out of kicking distance!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_0": "Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Look around\u2014have you ever seen so many Bulbasaur?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_1": "Personally, I\u2019ve only witnessed a gathering like this once before. It was some time ago, and there were so many Trainers out and about catching all the little Seed Pok\u00e9mon they could find.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_2": "In fact, seeing all these Bulbasaur has me feeling quite nostalgic!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_3": "It also reminded me of an important scientific tenet: there\u2019s always more to learn! And I never tire of researching Pok\u00e9mon, no matter the species.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_0_4": "In that spirit, what do you say we do some research on Bulbasaur, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer. That\u2019s a downright adorable Bulbasaur you\u2019ve caught!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_1": "Did you know that Bulbasaur uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back to grow?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_2": "I\u2019d love to have a built-in snack backpack. It would keep my stomach quiet in the field, that\u2019s for sure! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_3": "As you may know, Bulbasaur\u2019s Evolution\u2014Ivysaur\u2014gains strength when it\u2019s exposed to sunlight.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_4": "That sunlight also makes the bud on its back grow larger. It would be lovely to witness that phenomenon myself, for old time\u2019s sake.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_1_5": "While you go off and evolve your Bulbasaur, I\u2019ll continue following this pack of Bulbasaur I\u2019ve been observing. They appear to be on the move!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_0": "Goodness me, look at the size of that Ivysaur! Well done, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_1": "If memory serves, the bud on Ivysaur\u2019s back produces a sweet aroma when it starts to swell, indicating the flower\u2019s about to bloom.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_2": "Have you gotten a whiff of that scent yet? If you do, your Ivysaur may be getting ready to evolve!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_3": "Now, remember that pack of Bulbasaur I was following? A handful of Ivysaur have recently emerged from a nearby forest to join them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_2_4": "They all seem to be heading in the same direction... But what\u2019s their destination, I wonder? Let\u2019s go see if we can\u2019t dig up some answers, hm?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_0": "Welcome back %PLAYERNAME%. Hold on\u2014is that a Venusaur with you?! It must be my lucky day.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_1": "You see, the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur I was following led me to a grove where a Venusaur was resting. There was an unusual scent in the air that seemed to calm the Pok\u00e9mon that had gathered.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_2": "I\u2019ve read that Venusaur sometimes produces a scent that attracts other Pok\u00e9mon, so I surmised that\u2019s what was occurring.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_3": "In fact, the way the Bulbasaur and Ivysaur gathered around Venusaur reminded me of how Lure Modules work to attract Pok\u00e9mon via scent.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_4": "Now, let\u2019s talk Venusaur. Did you know it can Mega Evolve?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_5": "Take this Venusaur Mega Energy and try Mega Evolving your new friend. You\u2019ll learn more by experiencing Mega Venusaur\u2019s power for yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_bulbt_3_6": "There are so many things we can learn from Pok\u00e9mon, and researching them can lead us to even more exciting discoveries. I hope you enjoyed yourself during today\u2019s scientific excursion!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, you\u2019ve been such a help in conducting Field Research and Special Research!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_1": "I have a feeling that there\u2019s so much more about this world that we\u2019ve yet to discover, and I\u2019m glad I can count on you to see it through.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_2": "I\u2019ve been doing some experiments of my own, and I suspect that I\u2019m onto a further exciting discovery about another Mythical Pok\u00e9mon that\u2019s rarely seen.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_3": "Would you mind completing these tasks while I conclude my studies?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_0_4": "Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_0": "Wow, you and your Pok\u00e9mon have some amazing power! But according to my most recent data, it seems that the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019m tracking only appears in times of peace.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_1": "Also, from what I\u2019ve gathered, it seems fond of forests and lush greens. Would you mind exploring this further, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_1_2": "Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I feel we\u2019re getting closer to this Mythical Pok\u00e9mon. I wonder if we can find some more friends for it by hatching some Eggs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_1": "Ah, and maybe you could put that Sun Stone you\u2019ve earned to good use as well?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_2_2": "Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_0": "Oh wow, is that an Eevee you\u2019ve caught? Perfect timing!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_1": "Did you know that this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s unstable genetic makeup enables it to take on one of several different Evolutions?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_2": "I\u2019ll bet if you spend some time with it during the day, you\u2019ll be able to evolve your Eevee into an Espeon\u2014a Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon just like the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019m researching!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_3_3": "Can you {0}, {1}, and {2}?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_0": "Oh wow, is that an Eevee you\u2019ve caught? Perfect timing!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_1": "Wait... Have we...had this conversation already? I\u2019m getting a funny feeling in the back of my mind\u2014like we\u2019ve been here before.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_2": "%PLAYERNAME%, would you spend some time with this Eevee during the night? I think you\u2019ll be able to see an intriguing evolved form as a result.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_3": "I wonder if this funny feeling will recur...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_4_4": "Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, I have some exciting news! That funny feeling hasn\u2019t returned, but I did some important reading and learned that the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019re researching has the ability to travel across time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_1": "Maybe that\u2019s why all of this is occurring...or recurring... Maybe this Pok\u00e9mon is nearby?!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_2": "I suggest that you collect samples over the course of the next week and experiment with some Evolution items to see whether that feeling occurs again.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_3": "While you\u2019re at it, do you have any Pinap Berries? My research could benefit from more data on their use. Return with that, and you can have these exotic Silver Pinap Berries!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_5_4": "Please {0}, {1}, and {2}.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_0": "This data is so helpful. Thank you! I\u2019ll use it to explore my theory.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_1": "While you were in the field, I made more headway in learning about this Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, and it seems that its mere presence causes grass and trees to flourish.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_2": "I think if you catch more Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon, this elusive time-traveling Pok\u00e9mon will reveal itself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_6_3": "Let's {0}, {1}, and {2}.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, what an amazing experience! The appearance of the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Celebi is thought to be a sign that a bright and shining future awaits us.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_celebi_7_1": "You\u2019ve come a long way in your research, and I must say you\u2019re inspiring me to discover even more Pok\u00e9mon. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Just the Trainer I was looking for.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_1": "So you\u2019ve also noticed the sudden uptick in Chansey roaming around today. It\u2019s rare to see so many of them\u2014they\u2019re usually quite elusive!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_2": "Did you know Chansey are said to bring happiness to any Trainer lucky enough to catch one?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_3": "Perhaps that\u2019s why they\u2019ve gathered\u2014to bring us both an extra helping of happiness!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_0_4": "Say, why don\u2019t you try befriending one? With Chansey by your side, I bet joyful things won\u2019t be far behind!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. You seem happier already!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_1": "Have I mentioned that Chansey eggs are both rich in nutrients and extremely delicious? They\u2019re considered quite the high-class ingredient in the culinary world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_2": "Chansey evolve from Happiny, the Playhouse Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_3": "Happiny love round white things and are known to carry egg-shaped rocks in imitation of Chansey. They\u2019re much too small to lay their own eggs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_4": "If Happiny gets along well with someone, it will give them its rock. Tell me that isn\u2019t the cutest thing you\u2019ve ever heard!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_1_5": "Like Happiny, Chansey can also evolve. Try evolving Chansey\u2014and let me know when you do!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_0": "Excellent job, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_1": "Some say only Chansey that share a strong bond with their Trainer can evolve. If that\u2019s true, you should be very proud!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_2": "Blissey, like Happiny and Chansey, is very kindhearted.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_3": "Blissey senses sadness with its fluffy fur coat and will rush to the side of the forlorn\u2014no matter how far away they may be\u2014to share an egg of happiness.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_4": "Eating even one bite will bring a smile to any face.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_2_5": "I\u2019m grinning at the thought! And it looks like your Blissey is equally excited to get back out there and spread more happiness. I\u2019ll leave you to it and will see you again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_3_0": "What blissful buddies you two have become!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_3_1": "I\u2019d say we\u2019ve proven our earlier hypothesis\u2014all these Chansey made today\u2019s research an especially joyous job.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chansey_3_2": "And now that we\u2019re finished, I\u2019m famished. It\u2019s time for me to go encounter an omelet. See you later!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I hope you and your fellow Trainers have been taking care of yourselves. Remember to take a break every now and then to do something you really enjoy! I like to go on short walks, myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_1": "In fact, I was out for a stroll with my Buddy Pok\u00e9mon earlier when I heard a strange crackling sound.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_2": "Upon further inspection, I realized it was a large group of Charmander gathered in an open field! The source of the noise was the soft crackling of their tail flames.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_3": "Seeing so many Charmander at once was highly unusual, though this wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve witnessed such a gathering...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_4": "Well, whatever the reason, this is the perfect chance to learn more about Charmander!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_0_5": "Would you mind giving me a hand by catching some, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_0": "Wonderful work, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_1": "While you were out in the field, I looked through some research focused on Charmander and its Evolutionary line and came away with some interesting information.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_2": "For starters, Charmander is also known as the Lizard Pok\u00e9mon and seems to be fond of hot things. You can tell how a Charmander is feeling by looking at the flame burning at the tip of its tail. What a fascinating Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_3": "Hmmm... Perhaps those Charmander I ran into while walking were gathered to enjoy the sun? We may be able to learn more by evolving one.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_1_4": "Charmander\u2019s evolved form is Charmeleon\u2014but be careful when evolving Charmander! Charmeleon is known for its fiery temper!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_0": "That\u2019s a fine Charmeleon you\u2019ve got with you, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_1": "Known as the Flame Pok\u00e9mon, Charmeleon is hotheaded by nature and is constantly seeking out worthy opponents for battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_2": "When it finally encounters a worthy foe, it becomes so excited that the flame at the tip of its tail flares up and turns a bluish-white color.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_3": "The easiest way to calm a Charmeleon down is by winning a battle. That sure sounds like a certain team leader I know!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_2_4": "Now, did you know Charmeleon can evolve? Not only that, but its evolved form, Charizard, is also known as the Flame Pok\u00e9mon! Come back and see me once you\u2019ve evolved your Charmeleon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_0": "Congrats, Trainer! Your Charmeleon has now become the Flame Pok\u00e9mon Charizard!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_1": "Charizard is a truly amazing Pok\u00e9mon. Its wings can carry it close to an altitude of 4,600 feet, and its fiery breath packs such great heat that it can melt almost anything!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_2": "While all that raw power seems intimidating, Charizard never turns its flames on any opponent weaker than itself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_3": "What a superb display of control! It\u2019s amazing to see how this Pok\u00e9mon chooses to take on only the mightiest of opponents!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_3_4": "They say the key to a successful partnership is a powerful bond, Trainer, so why not celebrate by spending a little time with your new Charizard?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_0": "I can see you\u2019re really putting an effort into strengthening the bond between you and your Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you know that that bond can become a source of power for certain Pok\u00e9mon? That\u2019s right\u2014I\u2019m talking about Mega Evolution!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_1": "Mega Evolution is the result of a strong connection between a Pok\u00e9mon and its Trainer. Charizard is unique not only because it can Mega Evolve but also because it has two different Mega-Evolved forms!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_2": "Its two Mega Evolutions, Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y, each come with their own strengths.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_3": "It\u2019s said that the overwhelming power dwelling within Mega Charizard X is so intense that it turns its body black and causes blue flames to spill from its mouth.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_4": "Other research suggests that Mega Charizard Y uses its bond with its Trainer as the source of its power, resulting in speed and maneuverability greater than that of a fighter jet\u2019s.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_5": "Simply amazing! I can\u2019t wait to see how Trainers use these Mega Evolutions in their Gym battle strategies!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chart_4_6": "Thanks again for your help, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll be in touch as soon as I have more exciting research to share!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Watch your step, there are\u2014ow\u2014broken rocks all over today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_0_1": "I\u2019ve been too occupied sweeping them up to find the cause, so I\u2019m hoping you can help me figure out where they\u2019ve come from. As with most odd occurrences, I suspect a Pok\u00e9mon may be behind this.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_0_2": "Speaking of odd occurrences, I saw a shooting star last night! There\u2019ve been more and more of them lately\u2014always beautiful sights. Maybe some of these rocks are bits of meteor!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_0_3": "Anyway, I won\u2019t keep you, %PLAYERNAME%. Go see what Pok\u00e9mon are out today, and think about which ones might be inclined to shatter rocks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Judging by the Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve caught, I\u2019m guessing you think Chespin\u2019s the cause of the broken rocks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_1": "You know what they say: \u201cIf the shell fits!\u201d You know, when Chespin flex the quills on their heads, the points become so hard and sharp that they can pierce rock.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_2": "Pretty impressive, considering that the quills are usually soft.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_3": "And speaking of the wooden shell on its head\u2014that thing\u2019s so thick that even a direct hit from a truck wouldn\u2019t faze Chespin!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_1_4": "Luckily for us, they\u2019re good-natured Pok\u00e9mon...even if they might have been having some fun with the local boulders. Help Chespin evolve and I\u2019ll tell you more, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_0": "Well done! That\u2019s a strong-looking Quilladin, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_1": "See how the shape of its shell has changed? It relies on that sturdy shell to deflect predators\u2019 attacks, and then counterattacks with sharp quills.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_2": "Even so, they are very kind and won\u2019t start fights.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_3": "It\u2019s a quality that I imagine makes them ideal first partner Pok\u00e9mon for Trainers starting out in the Kalos region\u2014where Chespin, Quilladin, and Chesnaught were first discovered!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_2_4": "Speaking of Chesnaught, how about you help Quilladin evolve so we can observe one ourselves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_0": "Now that is one fine-looking Chesnaught, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_1": "Those quills on its back are bigger than ever, and when it takes a defensive posture with its fists guarding its face, it could withstand a bomb blast.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_2": "But just like Quilladin, this strapping Pok\u00e9mon has a heart of gold. It will even shield its allies from danger with its own body.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_3": "Now that\u2019s what I call a reliable partner!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_4": "And I know you\u2019ll look after Chesnaught in turn. That\u2019s just the kind of Trainer you are, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_chespin_3_5": "Thanks for spending another exciting day researching Pok\u00e9mon with me! I\u2019ll be in touch soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, hi! It\u2019s pretty hot out here, don\u2019t you think? The heat must be coming from all the Cyndaquil running about!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_1": "Are you familiar with it? It\u2019s a Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon known for its timid nature.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_2": "Since they scare easily, they\u2019re usually found curled up in a little ball\u2014and they\u2019ll flare the flames on their backs to protect themselves when attacked!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_0_3": "Why don\u2019t you grab a pocket fan to stay cool and try to catch one of these fascinating Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_0": "That\u2019s quite a Cyndaquil you\u2019ve befriended, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019re on fire\u2014er, not literally, thankfully.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_1": "Let me reward you with some fun tidbits! Did you know that a Cyndaquil\u2019s flames burn hottest when they\u2019re startled?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_2": "And its Evolution, Quilava, will turn its back on opponents just to show off how ferociously its fire blazes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_1_3": "Let\u2019s evolve your Cyndaquil into a Quilava. While I\u2019m not jumping at the idea of making it even hotter around here, I AM eager to study the variance in flame intensity as they evolve.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_0": "Amazing work, %PLAYERNAME%! Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at your Quilava. You\u2019re on a hot streak!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_1": "As I mentioned, Quilava tend to use the heat of their flames to intimidate foes. Those flames burn even stronger when it prepares to fight!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_2": "Your Quilava seems like a real firebrand! I bet it\u2019ll be even more of a force to be reckoned with once it evolves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_2_3": "On that note, let\u2019s turn the thermostat up to max\u2014evolve your Quilava into Typhlosion! There\u2019s learning to be had!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_0": "Oh! I was wondering why I was feeling so toasty, but now I see\u2014you\u2019re back with Typhlosion! Let\u2019s take a moment to marvel at its raw power.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_1": "When a Typhlosion\u2019s rage peaks, it gets so hot that it\u2019ll send anything that touches it up in flames!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_2": "I\u2019m pretty sure my eyebrows are getting singed, but it\u2019s totally worth it for an up-close encounter with such an awe-inspiring Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_cyndaquil_3_3": "You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%. Until our next adventure\u2014stay cool!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I just developed this new type of Incense\u2014Daily Adventure Incense.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_1": "One Daily Adventure Incense lasts for 15 minutes and stays active only while you\u2019re moving. Most importantly, though, this Incense can attract almost any Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve encountered before\u2014even Legendary Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dailyincense_0_2": "I\u2019ll give you one Daily Adventure Incense each day, so don\u2019t be afraid to go out on some adventures! In fact, why not start one now? Try to catch as many Pok\u00e9mon as you can!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_0": "Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! We\u2019ve come to the end of the year once again...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_1": "And it looks like some familiar Pok\u00e9mon from earlier this year are reappearing, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_2": "Do you think they\u2019re here to celebrate the year\u2019s end with us?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_3": "I hope you\u2019ll take a moment to reflect on all the ways you\u2019ve grown and the adventures we had these last 12 months.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_0_4": "We achieved the impossible, created legends, and discovered so much about ourselves! Which moment are you most proud of?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Wow, just look at all the Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve caught! Up for another challenge?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_1": "Will you evolve a few of them for me? I\u2019d say you\u2019ve evolved plenty yourself, as a Trainer, this year. Especially after all that time with Hoopa.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_2": "What mischief it made this year\u2014remember when it summoned all those Legendary Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_3": "The bond between Trainer and Pok\u00e9mon can change so much more than just a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s appearance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_1_4": "Just something to think about as you evolve your Pok\u00e9mon today!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_0": "With a new year just around the corner, I can\u2019t help but look back. What can we learn from the histories of places, Pok\u00e9mon, and our fellow Trainers?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_1": "That reminds me\u2014have you heard about the strange door I found recently? I have a feeling we\u2019re in for quite an adventure!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_2": "I wonder what mysteries hide behind that door. What can this relic tell us about the past\u2014and our shared future...?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_2_3": "Sorry, where were we? Ah, yes! Be sure to catch lots of Pok\u00e9mon, study how they evolve, and maybe work on improving your Pok\u00e9 Ball throws, too. Let\u2019s end the year awash in new knowledge!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_0": "You\u2019ve made it to the end, %PLAYERNAME%! Here\u2019s a reward for all your hard work. Consider it a token of my gratitude as well, for all you\u2019ve done for me this year.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2021_3_1": "I look forward to our adventures together next year! Are you ready? Then let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you! I always feel a little nostalgic at the end of the year.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_1": "So I thought we could look back on everything we\u2019ve done over the last twelve months.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_2": "For starters, you\u2019ve been putting that Daily Adventure Incense to great use... You\u2019ve encountered Zorua and been caught up in Ditto's shenanigans...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_3": "And that\u2019s just the beginning! Doesn\u2019t remembering your accomplishments get you energized for more?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_4": "It does for me, and maybe Pok\u00e9mon are feeling energized by the season too\u2014look how many are out there today!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_5": "I wonder if Pok\u00e9mon perceive time like we do? Hmm... This could be a good topic for next year\u2019s World Pok\u00e9mon Ecological Society conference.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_0_6": "As for you, you should go for a stroll and think about all the amazing things you\u2019ve done, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_0": "You\u2019ve brought a jolly bunch of Pok\u00e9mon with you, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_1": "Seeing all of them gets me thinking\u2014remember how lucky we were to meet so many Pok\u00e9mon first discovered in the Alola region?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_2": "We even encountered all of the island guardians! I\u2019d never seen them in person before\u2014had you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_3": "It just goes to show that the more time we spend exploring the world, the more exciting sights we\u2019ll see.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_4": "What\u2019s that? \u201cEven if that sight\u2019s on the other side of an Ultra Wormhole?\u201d",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_5": "Ha ha! Very true, even if the experience was a little stressful. But I think it was worth it in the end, especially since we made a new friend\u2014Rhi!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_1_6": "Speaking of which, why don\u2019t you pay Rhi a visit? In the meantime, please let me take a closer look at some of those Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve caught.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_0": "Seasonal greetings, %PLAYERNAME%.  Is this appropriate to say? I have only learned of \u201cseasons\u201d after coming to this world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_1": "You have been busy today. What has occupied your attention?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_2": "Reminiscing with Professor Willow? I am told that is a fitting activity for this time of the...day?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_3": "No\u2013year. I apologize. Tracking time by the sun\u2019s passage is new to me, although I do find it fascinating.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_4": "My thoughts? Hm.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_5": "As a member of the GO Ultra Recon Squad, I\u2019ve journeyed through countless dimensions to learn more about the nature of Ultra Beasts and Ultra Wormholes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_6": "I can confidently say that a world as vibrant and radiant as yours is quite rare.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_7": "As rare as making a friend as kind as you, %PLAYERNAME%. Your aid has been invaluable, both in acclimating me to this world and in containing the Ultra Beasts.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_8": "Our time together has been well-spent, from my perspective. If you are amenable, I would enjoy continuing our collaboration. Are you free right now?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_2_9": "I would like to observe as you catch some Pok\u00e9mon. Your accuracy is remarkable, and I suspect I could learn something watching you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_1": "That\u2019s another day of research done. Thank you for choosing to spend it with me\u2014and with Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_2": "This year has had its challenges, as they all do. But no matter what obstacles we face, I know I can rely on you to help overcome them...and that thought always brightens my day.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_3": "I hope that the time you\u2019ve spent with me and with Pok\u00e9mon has also been a source of joy, because you yourself bring joy to so many.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2022_3_4": "In fact, if I could make a wish right now, it\u2019d be for our next year to be just as amazing as this one. And with you around, hey\u2014I\u2019m sure it will be. See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe we\u2019re already approaching the year\u2019s end?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_0_1": "But what a year it\u2019s been! Rife with surprises, discoveries\u2014and so many Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_0_2": "In fact, I think I saw some familiar Pok\u00e9mon while I was out walking earlier. Perhaps they\u2019ve gathered to celebrate with us.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_0_3": "Why don\u2019t you get out there and try to catch a few?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_0": "We\u2019ve certainly crossed paths with some fascinating Pok\u00e9mon this past year, haven\u2019t we, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_1": "I\u2019ll never forget the moment I finally witnessed Kecleon\u2019s masterful camouflage firsthand.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_2": "And how about when we encountered all those Pok\u00e9mon first discovered in the Paldea region?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_3": "Watching those Bombirdier soaring overhead was a thrill and a half!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_4": "Which Pok\u00e9mon were you most excited to encounter this year, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_1_5": "Who knows\u2014the best may still be yet to come!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_1": "I was just reminiscing about all the ways we\u2019ve connected with fellow Trainers this past year.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_2": "From showcasing our favorite Pok\u00e9mon to partying up with friends and taking on challenges together, it feels like our community has never been more connected.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_3": "Do you ever stop while exploring a Route to think about all the other Trainers who\u2019ve walked that same path? All the incredible adventures they\u2019ve had and the ones they have ahead?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_2_4": "As we explore today, let\u2019s appreciate the wonderful community we\u2019re part of and the friends we\u2019ve made this year. Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_0": "Nice work, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_1": "You should be incredibly proud of what you\u2019ve achieved this year. I know I am!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_2": "And yet, something tells me you\u2019re only getting started.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_3": "Wherever our journey takes us next, I\u2019m grateful to be by your side.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec2023_3_4": "But enough about the future. Let\u2019s get back out there and enjoy the present!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_0": "Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s so great to see you. Can you believe this year is already coming to a close?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_1": "It\u2019s almost as if Pok\u00e9mon in the wild can feel it, too. A few seem to be appearing in greater numbers than usual!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_2": "Strangely enough, the Pok\u00e9mon appearing more frequently at the moment seem to be the same as those that did so previously throughout this year.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_3": "Seeing all these Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup in the wild is making me a bit nostalgic. We\u2019ve had quite a year, haven\u2019t we?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_4": "As you venture out to catch these Pok\u00e9mon, I think it might be nice to reminisce on some of the highlights from this year and how much you\u2019ve grown as a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer along the way.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_0_5": "Who knows\u2014you might even surprise yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_0": "Great job catching all those Abra, Rhyhorn, and Piplup, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_1": "As you were doing that, I was busy thinking about all we\u2019ve accomplished together this year.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_2": "We discovered the secrets of trade Evolution and met a vast variety of Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Unova region.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_3": "We even encountered Legendary Pok\u00e9mon like Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, and Kyurem!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_4": "Then there were the Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Galar region. I was particularly excited to see Galarian Ponyta, Galarian Rapidash, and Sirfetch\u2019d!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_5": "Oh! And who could forget the mysterious appearance of Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_6": "Hard to believe we fit all that into one year, eh, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_1_7": "Anyway, I\u2019ve rambled on long enough. It\u2019s time for you to get back out there and catch some more Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_0": "Ah\u2014Weedle, Gastly, and Seedot. The stars of some memorable days this past year! I still get a bit jumpy at the sight of acorns. Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_1": "Gastly gave us a bit of a fright as well. Remember?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_2": "OOOooooOOOoooo... BOO! Haha, sorry\u2014I couldn\u2019t help it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_3": "You know, Gastly isn\u2019t the only gaseous thing we saw in abundance this year.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_4": "That\u2019s right\u2014I\u2019m talking about Team GO Rocket taking to the sky in balloons! An almost cartoonish mode of transportation, and yet surprisingly effective.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_5": "You know, if the members of Team GO Rocket weren\u2019t so devoted to villainy, their assets and energy would likely make them great allies.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_6": "I hope that world comes to be someday.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_7": "Ah, pardon my wistfulness. I tend to get more and more pensive as the day wears on. Does that happen to you as well?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_2_8": "Perhaps you can ponder that while you go out and catch more Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_0": "It\u2019s certainly been an interesting year, hasn\u2019t it, %PLAYERNAME%? I can\u2019t remember another one like it, and I\u2019ve seen a few!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_1": "But despite all the ways it\u2019s challenged us, I can\u2019t help but think that it\u2019ll make future experiences feel even more precious and special.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_2": "After all, no matter what happens, we\u2019re all on this Pok\u00e9mon journey together\u2014every Trainer, regardless of where they are in the world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_3": "That\u2019s truly something special.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_4": "So when the going gets tough, remember that you\u2019re not in this alone. And while bad days are inevitable, I like to think they make the good ones that much sweeter.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_5": "I hope today has been one of the good ones for you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_6": "The world is ever changing, %PLAYERNAME%. What doesn\u2019t change, however, is the fact that we have each other and our Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_7": "And as the mysterious world of Pok\u00e9mon continues to grow, so do we\u2014as Trainers, as a community, and as people.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dec20cd_3_8": "So here\u2019s to a year for the books\u2014and many more exciting ones to come!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_0": "It appears their aggression is primarily fueled by necessity...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_1": "Ah! Greetings again, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. You have found me mid-observation. An astounding amount of these Pok\u00e9mon are present today\u2014Deino, is it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_2": "Bereft of sight, their first instinct is to bite. I have experienced this firsthand\u2014but do not fret. The pain was minimal.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_3": "This world is replete with unique Pok\u00e9mon. Though I wish to study them all, today\u2019s focus will be on Deino alone.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_0_4": "May I borrow some moments from you, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer? I would welcome your expertise in this endeavor.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_0": "Thank you for your assistance, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_1": "Deino tackle and bite at their surroundings. Even in darkness, they find novel ways to navigate the world...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_2": "......",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_3": "Ahem. Do you think the Deino seek anything in particular? Sustenance, perhaps?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_4": "I see. It is normal in your world to feed Berries to Pok\u00e9mon when attempting to catch them. Hmm... Deino may not be able to see, but I wonder how well they can smell and taste.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_1_5": "I wish to investigate the acuity of these senses by seeing how Deino respond to Berries. Will you assist me, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_0": "How dee, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. I have observed you sending Gifts to your friends affixed with charming decorations. Stuckums, is it? No? Ah\u2014stickers. What is the function of these adornments?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_1": "I see... So they are primarily decorative, but can also communicate certain sentiments. There seems to be much comradery among the Pok\u00e9mon Trainers in this world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_2": "Deino may bite and tackle each other, but perhaps what appears aggressive and unfriendly is simply an interaction we do not understand. Putting yourself in the mind of a Pok\u00e9mon can illuminate new perspectives, do you not think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_3": "Hm? Your Professor Willow would also share his observations of the Pok\u00e9mon you encountered? I hope you find my musings equally helpful.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_2_4": "If I may muse further: I am eager to observe Deino\u2019s Evolution. Its physical changes may inform its behavior.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_0": "Astounding. You have shown me yet another wonder of this world, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_1": "I did not anticipate Deino would gain an additional head when it evolved to Zweilous\u2014though I cannot discern if either head can see.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_2": "The two heads appear quite quarrelsome\u2014particularly regarding food. Ah\u2014be calm! There are Berries for all mouths!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_3": "Zweilous could learn much from the friendship you and I share. Perhaps it will do so as you travel together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_4": "I have learned recently that Zweilous can evolve into a Pok\u00e9mon called Hydreigon. Will it gain yet more heads? Will it trade quarrels for kindness?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_5": "Thank you for accompanying me in my investigation today, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_deino_3_6": "I presumed the mysteries of the Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts would be my primary focus here\u2014but the Pok\u00e9mon of your world hold many mysteries of their own.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Say, have you observed anything strange on your travels lately?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_0_1": "I\u2019ve been getting reports of a mysterious energy gathering around the world. This seems different than anything we\u2019ve seen before.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_0_2": "I\u2019m eager to figure out what\u2019s going on. Are you up for a little exploration?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_0_3": "Take a look around the area and let me know what you find!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_1_0": "Good Graveler, that Wooloo is massive!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_1_1": "This must be a Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon! Just imagine how much fabric you could make with all that wool. Let me know if you give it a spin!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_1_2": "Ahem. Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon have powerful techniques called Max Moves that can be enhanced with Max Particles.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_1_3": "Why don\u2019t you start collecting Max Particles while I research these moves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_2_0": "Check out that enhanced Max Move! I wouldn't expect any less from a Trainer such as yourself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_2_1": "And have you noticed the Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon appearing at Power Spots, those incredible energy sources you encountered?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_2_2": "This is a great opportunity to observe your Dynamax Wooloo in action.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dmax_ftue_2_3": "You can test its Max Moves against another Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon. Give it a GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%, great timing! Fancy doing a little investigation?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_1": "All these Ultra Wormholes we\u2019ve encountered lately have got me thinking. Ultra Space is fascinating, sure, but there are places closer to home that still beg to be explored\u2014like the fabled island of Dragonite!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_2": "Have you heard the tale?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_3": "Once, a Dragonite saved a shipwrecked man, taking him to a remote island\u2014a paradise occupied solely by Dragonite. Doesn\u2019t that sound like something, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_4": "Imagine the unique ecosystem that island would have! It\u2019d be a veritable treasure trove for scientific inquiry.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_5": "Questions are already rattling around in my head: what do Dragonite use their horns for? How quickly can they move in water? What kind of Berries do they\u2014",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_6": "Whoops. I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. First, we need to do some baseline research on the Pok\u00e9mon in question.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_7": "We might even find some clues about this Dragonite paradise! ",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_0_8": "Let\u2019s start by observing Dratini, which can evolve into Dragonair and then Dragonite, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_0": "Whoa! Look at how many Dratini you\u2019ve caught, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_1": "Did you know that in the past, Dratini was so rarely glimpsed that some called it the \u201cMirage Pok\u00e9mon\u201d?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_2": "And yet here you are with a whole host of them. They seem real enough to me!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_3": "You know, I read a report recently that a small colony of Dratini was found living underwater.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_4": "That would suggest that Dratini and its Evolutions like to live in groups.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_5": "And if that\u2019s true...then the island of Dragonite could be real after all! First, though, we should learn more about Dratini\u2019s Evolution, Dragonair.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_1_6": "Think you can find one, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_0": "What a majestic Dragonair, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_1": "Dragonair\u2019s mystical appearance always leaves me in awe. In fact, this Pok\u00e9mon is known for its gentle aura.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_2": "Some even call it divine! And for good reason\u2014see the crystalline globes on its head and tail? Dragonair can use them to freely control the weather.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_3": "I bet that\u2019d come in useful if you had, say, an island full of Dragonite that you wanted to keep hidden. Or if you were constantly forgetting your research notes outside on rainy days...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_2_4": "But that\u2019s a me problem. Next, let\u2019s help Dragonair evolve into the star of today\u2019s studies\u2014Dragonite!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_0": "Fantastic, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_1": "Just like Dratini and Dragonair, Dragonite is an extremely rarely seen Pok\u00e9mon. How lucky we are that we can study one today!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_2": "Dragonite is known as \u201cthe sea incarnate.\u201d Incur the wrath of this normally calm Pok\u00e9mon at your peril, because it will smash everything to smithereens before it\u2019s satisfied.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_3": "Luckily for us, it\u2019s typically a kindhearted Pok\u00e9mon. If it spots a drowning person or Pok\u00e9mon, Dragonite simply must help them\u2014like that shipwrecked man I mentioned earlier today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_4": "Why don\u2019t we set sail and get looking for that island? Dragonite\u2019ll surely bail us out if things go sideways!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_5": "I\u2019m joking, I\u2019m joking. Thanks for humoring me today, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_6": "Even without weighing anchor, we learned more about Pok\u00e9mon and found new ways to look at facts we already knew. I\u2019d say that\u2019s time well spent.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_dratini_cdc_3_7": "Though to be fair, I\u2019d say that about any time we spend together. Heh. I\u2019ll be in touch again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you noticed an increase in Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon appearing lately? Because I sure have.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_1": "I was conducting some research in my lab recently when I felt a chill run up my spine\u2014almost like something was watching me from the shadows.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_2": "I whirled around to face my uninvited guest and saw a Pok\u00e9mon floating eerily in the corner! Apparently startled by my gaze, it flew through the wall and escaped into the great outdoors. I haven\u2019t seen it since.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_3": "Based on my brief glimpse of it and its quick escape, I believe my visitor was Duskull, the Requiem Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s known to silently sneak up on its prey by making itself invisible. It also has the ability to slip straight through thick walls.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_0_4": "Naturally, my goal now is to learn more about Duskull. Can you lend me a hand? Hopefully we can come to understand why it was sneaking around my lab!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work researching Duskull. While you were out, I actually had another eerie encounter in my lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_1": "I saw Duskull slipping through a wall to scare me again, so I shouted, \u201cBOO!\u201d before it could and turned the tables. It fled back through the wall\u2014but then it reappeared and looked at me expectantly.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_2": "Thus began an impromptu game of peek-a-boo! It made me realize that Duskull may not get many chances to play with others because people are so quick to startle at its appearance. Makes you a bit sad, doesn\u2019t it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_1_3": "I wonder what else we can learn about Duskull. I know: Why don\u2019t you try evolving your Duskull into Dusclops? Also known as the Beckon Pok\u00e9mon, Dusclops apparently sucks everything in as if it were a black hole\u2014so be careful of its mouth!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_0": "Wait, %PLAYERNAME%, you did WHAT? I was so sure I told you NOT to feed a Berry to Dusclops... But maybe I said the opposite by mistake? Yeah, my bad on that one.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_1": "But it just ate the Berry normally, huh? No danger of you getting sucked in as well? Fascinating... O-oh, and, er, quite relieving! Yes, glad to see you back in one piece.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_2": "Now, let\u2019s learn more about Dusclops\u2019s Evolution, Dusknoir. Known as the Gripper Pok\u00e9mon, it\u2019s said to steal people and Pok\u00e9mon away at the behest of transmissions from the spirit world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_2_3": "No one knows whether Dusknoir has a will of its own. Sounds like a Pok\u00e9mon ripe for researching! Could you evolve your Dusclops for me so we can learn more?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_0": "Hey there, Trai\u2014 AAAH! G-G-G-GHOST! Behind you! It\u2019s\u2014 Wait. Is that Dusknoir? Hah, sorry about that. It\u2019s my first time seeing one!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_1": "No matter how spooky they may seem, we have to remember that Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon are Pok\u00e9mon all the same. They\u2019re looking for friends just like the rest of us!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_duskt_3_2": "Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope to see you and your Dusknoir again soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_1": "Not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, but there seems to be a huge influx of Eevee, the Evolution Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_2": "Some theorize that the key to the mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon Evolution lies within Eevee\u2019s genetics.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_3": "I can understand that hypothesis\u2014after all, Eevee can evolve into EIGHT Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_4": "I sure wish I were as adaptable as Eevee!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_5": "I don\u2019t even have eight different outfits. I basically wear this lab coat all the time\u2014even to formal events!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_6": "Anyway, perhaps by researching Eevee, we\u2019ll unravel even more mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon Evolution!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_0_7": "I can\u2019t wait to get started! Let\u2019s GO learn about Eevee!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_0": "Great work with your research on Eevee, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_1": "According to my findings, Eevee\u2019s irregular DNA gives it the ability to evolve into many different Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_2": "For example, it has three Evolutions originally discovered in the Kanto region: the Water-type Vaporeon, the Electric-type Jolteon, and the Fire-type Flareon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_3": "Isn\u2019t it fascinating that Eevee can evolve into Pok\u00e9mon of such different types?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_1_4": "As you work on your Eevee research, perhaps you might learn more about these Pok\u00e9mon. Good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you\u2019ve gotten a Vaporeon, a Jolteon, and a Flareon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_1": "These incredible creatures are capable of some impressive feats.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_2": "Did you know that Vaporeon can melt away into water?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_3": "Or that Jolteon can blast out 10,000-volt lightning bolts?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_4": "And that Flareon breathes fire that is over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_5": "Isn\u2019t it amazing that all three of these Pok\u00e9mon evolve from Eevee?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_6": "Perhaps there\u2019s something besides genetics that gives Eevee so much potential.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_7": "Let\u2019s do some more research to learn more about Eevee. At certain times of the day, this Pok\u00e9mon can evolve into Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Johto region: the Psychic-type Espeon and the Dark-type Umbreon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_2_8": "If you keep up your research, you might find them as well!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you\u2019ve gotten yourself an Espeon and an Umbreon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_1": "The Psychic-type Espeon can use the fine hair on its body to sense air currents and predict its enemies\u2019 next move. It usually evolves from Eevee during the daytime.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_2": "As for the Dark-type Umbreon, it evolves from Eevee during the nighttime. It\u2019s said that Umbreon\u2019s rings glow yellow under the full moon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_3": "Who would\u2019ve thought that something like the time of day could affect Pok\u00e9mon Evolution!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_4": "It\u2019s wonderful to delve even deeper into the mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_5": "Let\u2019s keep it up by researching Eevee\u2019s Evolutions that were originally discovered in the Sinnoh region.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_6": "The Grass-type Leafeon and Ice-type Glaceon seem to have evolved in order to adapt to their environment.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_3_7": "Why don\u2019t you research these Pok\u00e9mon next?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, welcome back!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_1": "I see you\u2019ve managed to get a Leafeon and a Glaceon! Congratulations!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_2": "The vastly different environments in the Sinnoh region appear to have caused the adaptable Eevee to evolve into a Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon and an Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s inspiring to see how resilient this little Pok\u00e9mon can be!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_3": "We might not uncover all the secrets of Pok\u00e9mon Evolution today, but I think we can learn a lot about ourselves through Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_4": "Researching Eevee today has taught me there are so many paths in life to choose from.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_5": "I hope that Eevee can inspire you to find the one that suits you best.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_6": "But enough of this professor\u2019s ramblings. Eevee is known to have just one more Evolution\u2014the Fairy-type Sylveon, which was originally discovered in the Kalos region.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_7": "This Pok\u00e9mon has ribbonlike feelers that it uses to calm others. Sylveon evolves from Eevee when it reaches a certain level of friendship and trust with its beloved Trainer. Knowing that almost brings a tear to my eye!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_8": "I hope you have the good fortune of crossing paths with a wonderful Pok\u00e9mon like Sylveon sometime soon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_eevet_4_9": "Until then, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m really glad to see you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_1": "I\u2019ve been dealing with some strange power outages in my mobile lab and wanted to investigate what could be causing them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_2": "It didn\u2019t take me long to find the cause. Seems as though a group of Electabuzz decided that the mobile lab\u2019s electricity would make an excellent snack.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_3": "Electabuzz seem to be appearing in higher numbers, which could lead to more outages.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_4": "Do you think you could catch some of these Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_0_5": "The research would be valuable, and I\u2019d be grateful to have my power restored!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_1": "Thanks for the assistance\u2014I really appreciate it! While you were out catching Electabuzz, I did some research on this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s Evolutionary line.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_2": "Did you know that Electabuzz evolves from Elekid?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_3": "A weak electric current flows between Elekid\u2019s horns. Be careful, Trainer! Sticking a hand between its horns will shock you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_4": "Hmm... I wonder whether Spark has tried that with his Buddy Pok\u00e9mon...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_1_5": "Anyway, let\u2019s keep researching these Electabuzz and make sure they aren\u2019t snacking on any electricity meant for other uses!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we have enough data on Electabuzz.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_1": "Also known as the Electric Pok\u00e9mon, it loves to feed on strong electricity. That explains why so many Electabuzz were attracted to my mobile lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_2": "Electricity runs across the surface of Electabuzz\u2019s body. In darkness, its entire body glows a whitish blue.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_3": "Simply amazing! Let\u2019s continue our research. Go ahead and use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve Electabuzz into Electivire!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_2_4": "I can\u2019t wait to see what electrifying facts we\u2019ll learn about that Evolution!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_0": "I just don\u2019t ever know whether they find my jokes funny... Should I take a comedy class?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_1": "OH! I didn\u2019t see you there, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you\u2019ve evolved your Electabuzz into Electivire like I asked. Thank you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_2": "According to the Pok\u00e9dex, as Electivire\u2019s electric charge amplifies, blue sparks begin to crackle between its horns.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_3": "When in battle, Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against its foe, then lets loose with over 20,000 volts of power. I guess you could say its opponent is in for a shock!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_4": "Be careful with this Pok\u00e9mon when battling with it\u2014that\u2019s a lot of power you\u2019re dealing with!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_5": "With the lights back on in the mobile lab, I\u2019m going to head back and wrap up some other projects.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_elect_3_6": "Thank you again for all your help, and until next time, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_electric_rd_mar24_1_0": "Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! We\u2019ve got all sorts of Pok\u00e9mon to catch\u2014and plenty of research that needs doing\u2014ahead of us. I can\u2019t wait to get started!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_electric_rd_mar24_1_1": "Which of these Pok\u00e9mon are you looking forward to encountering the most?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_0": "*yawn*",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_1": "Oh, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Sorry you caught me mid-yawn. I was up late reading the newest Pok\u00e9mon Researcher\u2019s Weekly.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_2": "There was a fascinating article about Fennekin, and coincidentally, they\u2019re all over the place today!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_3": "Did you know Fennekin are filled with energy after eating twigs? If that worked for me, I would\u2019ve made myself a plate of scrumptious sticks to get through my reading last night.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_4": "But why read about Fennekin when we can make our own observations!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_5": "What kind of twigs do Fennekin prefer? Do you think each Fennekin has a unique preference?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_0_6": "Think on those questions while you observe the Fennekin in the area, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_1": "Have you gathered any promising information? I see you\u2019ve at least gathered some promising Fennekin!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_2": "They sure are cute and fluffy, but I\u2019d be careful about getting too close. Their roomy ears vent blistering hot air.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_3": "Hmm... These fine Fennekin don\u2019t look like they have any twigs on them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_4": "Maybe we\u2019ll get a better view of some sprigs with Fennekin\u2019s Evolution, Braixen. Instead of snacking on twigs, they stick them in their tails.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_1_5": "If you\u2019re curious why, bring one by and I\u2019ll tell you all about it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_0": "What a beautiful Braixen, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_1": "I\u2019ll tell you about that twig, as promised.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_2": "When the twig is plucked from its tail, friction sets it alight. It uses the flame to send signals to its allies.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_3": "What do you suppose Braixen communicate about? Maybe where to find the most energizing stick snacks?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_4": "These Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s cleverness with tools doesn\u2019t stop there. Braixen\u2019s Evolution, Delphox, can use branches to see into the future.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_2_5": "I\u2019m no Delphox, but I sure see a Delphox in your future!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_0": "Looks like my prediction came true, %PLAYERNAME%! That Delphox of yours is downright delightful!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_1": "Delphox gaze into the flame at the tip of their branches to achieve a focused state, allowing them to see into the future.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_2": "And when they use their psychic power, they can generate a fiery vortex, incinerating foes swept into this whirl of flame.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_3": "It\u2019s a wonder their branches don\u2019t catch fire! Could Delphox be using their psychic powers to protect their branches?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_4": "If you continue observing your Delphox, perhaps you\u2019ll find the answer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_fennekin_3_5": "But until then, thanks for spending another day researching with me. See you later, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. How\u2019s your day?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_1": "Personally, mine is going swimmingly. Or perhaps\u2026flappingly? You see, an enormous flock of Fletchling has gathered nearby.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_2": "I heard some Pok\u00e9mon chirping up a storm, so I went to investigate and found Fletchling as far as the eye can see!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_3": "Fletchling is known as the Tiny Robin Pok\u00e9mon, and it\u2019s typically quite amiable and easy to train. Send it into battle, though, and you\u2019ll quickly see its more ferocious side!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_4": "A fascinating little Pok\u00e9mon. But as glad as I am to see it here, it\u2019s quite odd for so many to gather in one place.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_0_5": "Would you mind conducting some research so we can better understand what\u2019s going on?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_0": "Great work, Trainer. Looks like you\u2019ve got your very own Fletchling to join you on your journey!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_1": "Did you know that Fletchling\u2019s body is always warm? In fact, Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with this Pok\u00e9mon in their beds. How about that?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_2": "I\u2019m always fascinated to learn about how Pok\u00e9mon and their Trainers work and live together. And it never hurts to know how to cope on cold nights, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_3": "Anyway, Fletchling evolves into the Fire- and Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon Fletchinder.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_4": "Known as the Ember Pok\u00e9mon, Fletchinder is exceedingly territorial and aggressive.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_5": "It\u2019s also incredibly fast. Its speed from takeoff puts it easily among the fastest of all bird Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_1_6": "When you\u2019re ready, why don\u2019t you try evolving your Fletchling into Fletchinder? I\u2019d love to witness that famous speed firsthand!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_0": "That\u2019s a mighty fine Fletchinder you have there, %PLAYERNAME%. Congratulations!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_1": "Naturally, I\u2019ve been busy as well. In fact, I have some information you may find useful as you train Fletchinder.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_2": "You see, Fletchinder is known to expel embers from its beak to set grass on fire. Then, it pounces on the bewildered prey that flee the flames.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_3": "Pretty intense, huh? Best not to wing it during training, if you catch my draft\u2014er, drift.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_4": "Try not to let any fires Fletchinder starts get out of hand, too. We\u2019re all responsible for caring for our environment, after all!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_5": "With that said, there are still a few more tasks I\u2019d like you to complete in aid of our research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_2_6": "Chief among those is to obtain a Talonflame, the evolution of Fletchinder. They\u2019re said to have simply magnificent wings! Do you think you could evolve your Fletchinder, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014and hello, Talonflame!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_1": "I know I\u2019ve put you through your paces today, but it\u2019s all paid off in the end! You\u2019re now the proud Trainer of Talonflame, the Scorching Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_2": "Talonflame is known to shower embers from the gaps between its feathers during the heat of battle. It then takes to the air, reaching speeds of up to 310 mph.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_3": "Remember how I mentioned Talonflame\u2019s wings before? Fire can\u2019t pass through them, so they were used to outfit firefighters way back when.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_4": "Amazing stuff! I\u2019m always impressed by this brave bird. The two of you will no doubt accomplish great things\u2014and at great speeds!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_5": "Thanks for your help today, Trainer. I hope you had as much fun as I did!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flett_3_6": "Now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flock_together_rd_may24_1_0": "Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! We\u2019ve got all sorts of Pok\u00e9mon to catch and research that needs doing. I can\u2019t wait to get started!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_flock_together_rd_may24_1_1": "Which of these fine feathered friends are you hoping to spot?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s great to see you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_1": "Speaking of being seen, I\u2019ve been getting the feeling that something\u2019s watching me while I\u2019ve been out walking.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_2": "I\u2019m fairly certain my mystery observer is a Pok\u00e9mon, but I haven\u2019t the froggiest what it could be.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_3": "I suppose there\u2019s only one way to know for sure...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_0_4": "Let\u2019s hop to it, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_1": "Your investigation went better than I could have possibly hopped. What a delight to see Froakie up close!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_2": "Froakie secretes flexible bubbles from its chest and back. The bubbles reduce the damage it would otherwise take from attacks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_3": "If you think that\u2019s cool, just wait till you see Froakie\u2019s Evolution!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_1_4": "Why don\u2019t you try evolving Froakie for yourself?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_0": "Nice job, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_1": "Frogadier\u2019s swiftness is unparalleled. It can scale a tower of more than 2,000 feet in only a minute!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_2": "On top of that, Frogadier can throw bubble-covered pebbles with precise control. Quite the skill set, wouldn\u2019t you say?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_3": "I tend to associate bubbles with baths, personally\u2014I never would have thought to use them to cover pebbles!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_4": "Frogadier\u2019s pretty impressive, but I\u2019ve heard its Evolution is even more so.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_5": "Will you help me study it, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_2_6": "Let\u2019s put a spring in our step!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_0": "Wow\u2014you made quick work of that, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_1": "Greninja can create throwing stars out of compressed water. When it throws them at high speed, they can even split metal in half!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_2": "Quite the upgrade from Frogadier\u2019s bubble-coated pebbles, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_3": "Thanks for helping me learn more about Froakie and its Evolutions, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_4": "Between Greninja\u2019s grace and your skills as a Trainer, I\u2019m sure the two of you can overcome any obstacle. Maybe even split it in two! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_froakie_3_5": "Now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s so great to see you! The strangest things have been happening lately.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_1": "You see, I begin each day with a Pinap Berry and coffee for breakfast, then head outside my lab to take in the crisp morning air before starting my research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_2": "A couple days ago, however, I stepped outside and slipped on a sheet of ice right outside the entrance of my lab! Coffee\u2014spilled. Pinap Berry\u2014squished. Day\u2014ruined.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_3": "At first, I thought the ice formed because it was an especially chilly day, but it was in fact nowhere near cold enough to create a sheet of ice that thick!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_0_4": "For my sake\u2014and my breakfast\u2019s\u2014can you help me research Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon to see whether we can discover anything? *sniffle* My poor breakfast...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! We\u2019ve learned quite a bit about Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon, and it looks as if you\u2019ve caught a few interesting ones!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_1": "I feel like we\u2019re getting closer to finding out the cause of my breakfast\u2019s untimely demise. Oh! There\u2019s something I forgot to mention.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_2": "That very evening\u2014after an incredibly sad, breakfast-less day\u2014I was trying to cheer myself up by dressing in my comfiest pajamas and drinking a cup of herbal tea before tucking into bed.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_3": "As I lay there, ready to count Mareep and fall asleep, I was suddenly awoken by some unnerving tapping outside my lab! It sounded like...tap-dancing?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_4": "I was simply too comfortable in bed\u2014and too frightened\u2014to get up and check. All I could do was lie there and hope the tapping would end soon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_5": "I now believe source of that tapping was the same Pok\u00e9mon that created the sheet of ice in front of my mobile lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_1_6": "Can you investigate some Pok\u00e9mon related to making peculiar sounds? Let\u2019s see whether we can get closer to solving this case before it goes cold.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_0": "... ... ... OH! %PLAYERNAME%, you scared me. I was a bit distracted thinking about the tap-dancing I heard last night, as well as the shadow I saw pass by my window.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_1": "Oh, I didn\u2019t mention that last part? Yes, it was quite an unnerving experience! Anyway, let me take a look at all the research you\u2019ve done.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_2": "Oh! OH! Oh my goodness! All right, I think I know the source of these strange occurrences now.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_3": "I believe the culprit is the Galarian form of the Barrier Pok\u00e9mon\u2014Mr. Mime!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_4": "Galarian Mr. Mime is known as the Dancing Pok\u00e9mon. It likes to create a sheet of ice and tap-dance on it. What a strange Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_2_5": "While Galarian Mr. Mime is the prime suspect, it\u2019s still just a hunch. Can you go out and do a bit more research to confirm? Maybe you might even come across a Galarian Mr. Mime!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_0": "Phew! Great job catching that Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%! I guess it\u2019s not as frightening as I first thought.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_1": "Perhaps it\u2019ll become even more approachable when it evolves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_2": "I\u2019ve read that Galarian Mr. Mime evolves into Mr. Rime, the Comedian Pok\u00e9mon. Mr. Rime is apparently highly skilled at tap-dancing and waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_3_3": "I wonder whether it could teach me some new moves. Haha! Anyway, how about you try evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_0": "What a fascinating Pok\u00e9mon Mr. Rime is! Thank you for evolving your Galarian Mr. Mime, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_1": "I've heard stories of Mr. Rime\u2019s amusing movements, and you know what? Color me amused. What a COOL discovery this was!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_2": "This has definitely been an unforgettable adventure, but I\u2019m not sure I can say I\u2019d do it again, given the chilling way it started. My poor breakfast...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_galarian_mrmime_4_3": "Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%. Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Excellent timing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_1": "I just made a tremendously exciting discovery!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_2": "Earlier today, I was exploring a nearby cave to collect some samples when I noticed a peculiar warmth along one of the walls.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_3": "Suddenly, something jumped out and tried to bite me!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_4": "I quickly realized I had stumbled upon a nest of Gible, the Land Shark Pok\u00e9mon. Gible is known to react to anything that moves, so sometimes it leaps out and chomps passersby.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_5": "I know it just wanted a nibble, but that\u2019s a nibble too much in my book!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_0_6": "Anyway, it\u2019s not every day you run into a gaggle of Gible. Do you think you could head out and do some research on their appearance here?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_1": "While you were out tracking down the Land Shark Pok\u00e9mon, I took a closer look at the cave I was telling you about earlier.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_2": "I was reminded of an interesting tidbit about Gible. It nests inside small, horizontal holes in cave walls warmed by geothermal heat.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_3": "Gible seems to love warm places, and that cave certainly fits the bill.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_4": "We\u2019ve learned a lot about this Dragon- and Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon, but there\u2019s always more to discover!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_1_5": "When you\u2019re ready, how about you try evolving your Gible into Gabite?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_0": "Nice job evolving your Gible into Gabite, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_1": "Gabite is known as the Cave Pok\u00e9mon, and it loves sparkly things.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_2": "It emits ultrasonic waves from protrusions on either side of its head to probe pitch-dark caves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_3": "What a useful ability! Maybe it could help me avoid bumping into lab equipment in the middle of the night...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_2_4": "We\u2019ve seen Gible and Gabite, but there\u2019s still one more Evolution we need to document. Come see me when you\u2019ve evolved your Gabite, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_0": "Ah! Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%. That\u2019s an admirable Garchomp!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_1": "Known as the Mach Pok\u00e9mon, its body is covered in fine scales that reduce drag, enabling it to fly at high speeds.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_2": "Those scales don\u2019t just reduce wind resistance\u2014their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent that touches them. Pretty spiffy, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_3": "I think you\u2019ll find Garchomp to be a powerful companion on your adventures.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_4": "And I can\u2019t wait to see how your relationship develops along the way!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_5": "Thanks for all your help today, Trainer. I hope you had a fin-tastic time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_giblt_3_6": "Now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_1": "I was ready for a fun-filled day of playing with Pok\u00e9mon, but as you may have seen, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena occurring!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_2": "We need to figure out what\u2019s happening and set it right, so I'm asking for your help.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_3": "Now that you\u2019re here, I need you to be part of my Elite Research team.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_4": "First things first\u2014could you help survey the park and get some supplies?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_0_5": "Please complete the following research tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_0": "Yowzers! As you may have noticed, the park has all sorts of unusual geological phenomena going on today!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_1": "I\u2019m not sure what could have caused it\u2014they just appeared out of nowhere...and they seem to be getting bigger and bigger!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_2": "Whatever is causing it, the local park habitat here is quite disrupted by all the changes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_3": "The local Pok\u00e9mon have become confused\u2026 It looks like they\u2019re acting more aggressive and territorial!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_4": "Let's see if we can help out by catching some Pok\u00e9mon to make the situation a bit more stable.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_1_5": "Please catch some Fire-, Steel-, Water-, Grass-, Rock-, and Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_0": "Well, it looks like there were some pretty powerful Pok\u00e9mon causing the ruckus. Thanks for taking care of them! I'm sure they'll make great friends.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_1": "However, I'm not sure that was sufficient\u2014the strange habitats are just as active as before. The local park and all the Pok\u00e9mon here seem worried. We need to get to the bottom of this!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_2": "I've been seeing some unusual Pok\u00e9mon called Unown floating around the area...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_3": "This Pok\u00e9mon is shaped like ancient writing\u2026and I think they may be trying to tell us something! I think they want us to call on a powerful Pok\u00e9mon\u2014the Guardian of the Forest? I'll bet if we follow the Unown around the park, they'll lead us to this Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_2_4": "Let's do the following research tasks.\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_0": "Amazing! Never thought I would see Celebi here.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_1": "I think Celebi's time travel abilities may be exactly what we need to fix the situation.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_2": "Celebi can go back in time and stop these distortions while they're still small!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_3": "It's a difficult task\u2026 We need to ensure Celebi has all the support it needs!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_4": "The Plusle and Minun in the park would be perfect to help us out.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_5": "These Pok\u00e9mon are famous for loving teamwork and cheering on their partners with their pom-poms made of sparks!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_6": "If we collect a bunch, I think they'll be able to work together to get Celebi really pumped up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_7": "Then Celebi can focus its power to return to the past and prevent this problem before it starts!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_3_8": "Quickly, %PLAYERNAME%, let's complete these research tasks!\n{0}\n{1}",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_0": "That did it! It seems like the strange habitats are slowly returning to normal.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_1": "It appears that Celebi has safely returned from the past to stay with you. Looks like you two have formed a bond!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_2": "I'll bet by next weekend the park will have returned to its old self! Celebi is truly a wondrous Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_3": "Thanks for all your help today! We couldn't have done it without you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gofest_4_4": "This weekend will be one to remember!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_0": "Oh! Hi, %PLAYERNAME%! Don\u2019t mind the mess...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_1": "I was just enjoying the shade and jotting down a few notes when I noticed some slime on my coat.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_2": "Research opportunities come in unexpected forms, and I have an inkling this residue belongs to a certain clingy culprit.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_0_3": "While I figure out how to clean this up, could you look around and let me know if you observe anything interesting in the area?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_0": "Aha! I knew it! This goo came from Goomy, the Soft Tissue Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_1": "Goomy tend to live in damp, shady places so their bodies don\u2019t dry out. I should\u2019ve watched where I was sitting!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_2": "I\u2019d love to learn more about Goomy and its Evolutions while we have this opportunity.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_1_3": "Given that you seem better than me at staying slime-free, would you mind evolving Goomy into Sliggoo?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_0": "You\u2019re a slime savant, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_1": "But take extra care around your new Sliggoo. Its mucus can dissolve pretty much anything.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_2": "Also, I don\u2019t want to alarm you, but it\u2019s worth mentioning that Sliggoo are known to have trouble drawing a line between friends and food.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_2_3": "Might be worth seeing if yours is ready to evolve. It could save you the trouble of fending off a well-intentioned but melty hug!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_0": "Simply slime-tastic, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_1": "Goodra is an amazingly friendly Pok\u00e9mon with a penchant for hugging its Trainer. And yes, before you ask\u2014that can make things pretty gooey.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_2": "This Pok\u00e9mon isn\u2019t all slime and rainbows though. The strikes from Goodra\u2019s horns land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_goomy_3_3": "Anyhow, thanks for sticking with this research! I hope you and your Goodra stay together for many years to come!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_1": "I take it you\u2019ve noticed the influx of Grubbin in the area today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_2": "These Pok\u00e9mon spit sticky threads to stop opponents in their tracks\u2014so you\u2019d be wise to stay on their good side!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_3": "Grubbin generally live underground, though... I wonder what\u2019s lured them to the surface today. Can you catch a few to investigate?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_4": "Perhaps it\u2019s simply strength in numbers. Grubbin\u2019s natural enemies sometimes prefer fleeing over risking a run-in with the Larva Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s powerful mandibles\u2014or worse, an unexpected shock!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_4_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you discovered why so many Grubbin have appeared above ground today?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_5": "I\u2019ve also heard Grubbin loves snacking on sweet tree sap. Do you think it tastes anything like Pinap Berry juice?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_6": "Maybe I\u2019d better try some myself... Y-you know, for science!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_7": "Ahem. Grubbin is certainly a fascinating Pok\u00e9mon, but just wait till you see its Evolution.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_1_8": "Why don\u2019t you go ahead and evolve a Grubbin yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_0": "Nice Charjabug, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_1": "Charjabug can store electricity in its body to use later. Apparently it\u2019s a popular companion on camping trips!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_2": "It also like to bury itself in fallen leaves and munch away on the rich topsoil beneath.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_3": "Tread carefully out there, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014you and Charjabug might be equally shocked if you step on one!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_4": "Nobody likes to be interrupted while they\u2019re lost in the feed.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_5": "Anyway, you\u2019re sure to be impressed by Charjabug\u2019s electric power. Its mandibles may be smaller than Grubbin\u2019s, but don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking it\u2019s a pushover!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_6": "You know, Charjabug can evolve too. I\u2019ve never witnessed its Evolution myself, but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s quite a sight!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_2_7": "Why don\u2019t you try evolving your Charjabug, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_0": "Wow\u2014it\u2019s Vikavolt!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_1": "Who would have thought that a little Grubbin would eventually evolve into this stunning, winged creature?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_2": "Vikavolt builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_3": "They\u2019ve also been known to carry Charjabug to use as spare batteries, allowing Vikavolt to rapidly fire off fully powered attacks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_4": "It sounds a bit intimidating, but it\u2019s also a lovely example of two Pok\u00e9mon working in tandem. Inspiring stuff, if you ask me!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_grubbin_3_5": "Who knows\u2014maybe your Vikavolt will act as a battery of sorts and keep YOU charged up while adventuring together! I\u2019m looking forward to hearing all about it. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Something odd is happening, and I need your help investigating it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_1": "While I was on a walk last night with my Buddy Pok\u00e9mon, Meltan, I noticed a strange light flickering in my mobile lab. It was so spooky! One might\u2019ve called it...a ghastly sight!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_2": "Apparently, some Gastly were in my mobile lab hiding from the wind. It\u2019s common for them to take shelter when massive gusts are blowing about so their gaseous bodies aren\u2019t blown away.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_0_3": "However, the sheer number of Gastly seemed unusual. They\u2019re still in the mobile lab, so could you help me look into this situation?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_0": "Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were helping with our research, I was assisting the Gastly in the mobile lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_1": "I had to be careful when I got near the Gastly. I didn\u2019t want to be engulfed by their gaseous bodies!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_2": "Now that the Gastly are out of the mobile lab, I think it\u2019s time for us to start looking into Gastly\u2019s Evolution.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_1_3": "I\u2019ve done some reading on the matter, and I think we\u2019ll need to prepare for a dangerous Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Seems as though your Gastly has evolved into Haunter. I had a feeling I was being watched.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_1": "It\u2019s said that Haunter lurks in walls to keep an eye on its foes, but in this case, I have a feeling it\u2019s just being playful.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_2": "I\u2019ve noticed the team leaders tripping and stumbling around the lab today. Seems as if Haunter is having a bit of fun with them, but I don\u2019t think Blanche is amused.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_2_3": "Let\u2019s go ahead and fix that problem by evolving Haunter.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_0": "Congrats, Trainer. Your Haunter has now become the Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, Gengar! Are you ready for a spooky story? Let me get my flashlight.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_1": "If you ever see your shadow suddenly and startlingly overtake you, it might be a Gengar running past you, pretending to be your shadow!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_2": "Do you feel that chill in the air? That means a Gengar is near. OOOoooOOOooo...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_3": "BOO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_4": "Hahaha, got you, %PLAYERNAME%! I crack myself up. Although...it looked for a second like there was a ghostly hand on your shoulder... Maybe it was just my imagination.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_5": "Anyway, I know an accomplished Trainer such as yourself has nothing to fear when it comes to training a Pok\u00e9mon like Gengar. Being both Poison- and Ghost-type, it\u2019s a fantastic Pok\u00e9mon to have on your team.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_gt_3_6": "Thanks to your help, I think we all learned something today! I\u2019ll be in touch when I have another adventure for you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_0": "OoOoOo... There\u2019s a chill in the air... Can you feel it, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_1": "Seems like I\u2019ve been getting goosebumps every few minutes lately! Is it just drafty, or are all the Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019ve been seeing somehow involved?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_2": "Either way, I think we\u2019re in for another adventure! Whatever happens, we\u2019ll face it together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_3": "Speaking of faces, I\u2019ve noticed a lot of Yamask in the area lately.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_4": "I\u2019ve been hoping to do some research on it and other Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon, so it seems like now\u2019s the time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_0_5": "Mind lending me a hand, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_0": "Ah\u2014a Yamask AND a Duskull!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_1": "I recently had an encounter with a Duskull that seemed creepy at first but ended up being quite heartwarming.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_2": "It was a lovely reminder not to judge a Pok\u00e9mon by its...well, skull, I suppose!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_3": "Now, about that Yamask.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_4": "Known as the Spirit Pok\u00e9mon, Yamask is said to wander through ruins by night carrying a mask that was once its human face.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_5": "A rather melancholy existence, if true, wouldn\u2019t you say?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_6": "What must it feel like to carry around a mask of your former self? No offense to Yamask, but I hope I never have to find out firsthand.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_7": "Did you know that Yamask found in Galar are different than those found in Unova?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_8": "Perhaps you\u2019ll come across one while you\u2019re out conducting research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_1_9": "I wonder just how these Yamask differ. Let\u2019s go find out!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_0": "Wow, a Galarian Yamask!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_1": "Unlike Yamask first found in Unova, Galarian Yamask carries a slab rather than a mask.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_2": "It\u2019s said that the slab bears cursed engravings and possesses Yamask itself. Talk about spooky!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_3": "Oh, and you\u2019ve encountered a Banette, too! Did you know that Banette is said to be a doll that became a Pok\u00e9mon through the power of its grudge toward the child that disowned it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_4": "I wouldn\u2019t want to be that kid, that\u2019s for sure!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_5": "Between Galarian Yamask\u2019s slab, Banette\u2019s puppet body, and all the Pok\u00e9mon in costumes walking around, it feels like the spooky factor\u2019s turned way up at the moment!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_6": "Even so, I\u2019d still like to learn more about Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_2_7": "Come on, Trainer\u2014let\u2019s get back out there!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_0": "Looks like we\u2019re coming up on the last stretch of our research here, Trainer. And hey, it looks like you found yourself an Alolan Marowak!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_1": "Did you know that the bones used by some Marowak belonged to their mothers?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_2": "In fact, Cubone\u2014which evolves into Marowak\u2014is even said to wear the skull of its mother.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_3": "When Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak, its mother\u2019s regrets protect it like a vengeful spirit.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_4": "Hmm. Between Alolan Marowak, Banette, and Yamask, we\u2019ve witnessed the power of quite a few spirits, haven\u2019t we?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_5": "Try as I might to explain why Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon seem spooky, sometimes I just come up blank. But that won\u2019t stop me from continuing to try!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_6": "After all, I always feel like I learn a bit more about myself when I\u2019m studying Pok\u00e9mon. You know what I mean?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_2021_3_7": "Anyway, I think we\u2019re more than due some rest and treats after all that research. See you next time, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%. It is fortunate you\u2019ve arrived.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_1": "I just observed a curious sight.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_2": "Floating over there were vaguely human visages, and carved slabs of...clay?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_3": "Yet despite the differences between these apparitions, they had a similar air.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_4": "As with many mysterious things in this world, I suspect Pok\u00e9mon to be behind this.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_0_5": "Assuming I am correct, I wish to catch them. Then perhaps Professor Willow can share his insight.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_0": "Where\u2019s that old getup of mine\u2014oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_1": "I\u2019ve been thinking of what to wear to Spark\u2019s upcoming costume party. A Litwick hat? A Pikachu onesie? I can\u2019t have Candela outshine me again this year.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_2": "Speaking of masquerades\u2014is that a Yamask AND a Galarian Yamask? I can\u2019t disguise my excitement!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_3": "You know, they say Yamask carry masks that used to be their faces when they were human. Sometimes they look at them and cry.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_4": "And Galarian Yamask are supposedly formed when ancient clay tablets are drawn to vengeful spirits.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_5": "Somber origins, but don\u2019t they set your curiosity ablaze? I wonder how Yamask feel now that they\u2019ve become Pok\u00e9mon. What sort of thoughts are running through their minds?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_1_6": "In the \u201cspirit\u201d of inquiry, why don\u2019t you see what other Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon you can find? You might even come across more Yamask!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_0": "Professor Willow is certainly knowledgeable. We were right to seek his wisdom.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_1": "To think that Yamask and Galarian Yamask have such origins... Incredible.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_2": "I must thank you for catching them. With every day we spend together, I learn something new.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_3": "The Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019ve seen of late have been...dark, in a manner of speaking.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_4": "But as the Professor said, they are simply another mystery we researchers can illuminate with our findings. Fear need not be a component of exploring the unknown.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_5": "%PLAYERNAME%, I shall continue observing these Yamask as I ponder today\u2019s events.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_6": "Perhaps you could investigate other Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon in the meantime.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_2_7": "And to repay Professor Willow, I could see if I possess a GO Ultra Recon Squad uniform in his size...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. I\u2019ve just about finished my Yamask, erm, mask, inspired by you and Rhi! What\u2019ve the two of you been up to?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_1": "Whoa, you\u2019ve caught even more Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon! It\u2019s starting to look like a haunted house around here\u2014or a haunted lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_2": "Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon always remind me how much remains in the world for us to uncover. Where do Drifloon drift off to? Do Duskull really spirit away bad children? What powers a Golett?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_3": "With enough time and perseverance, I\u2019m sure we researchers will find the answers to these questions and more. Or maybe they\u2019ll be answered by an up-and-at-\u2019em Trainer like you! When it comes to learning, jump in headfirst, I always say!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_4": "Though...maybe I should amend that motto to exclude Ultra Wormholes. Haha.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallow_22_3_5": "Thanks for the extra motivation today, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll see you again soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_0": "BOO! Haha, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_1": "Hope I didn\u2019t scare you too badly. I was just having a bit of fun during this spooky season.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_2": "Say, since you\u2019re here, I was wondering whether you could help me. I\u2019ve heard some reports of an unusual Pok\u00e9mon appearing in a nearby forest.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_3": "Why aren\u2019t I going into that dark forest to find this Pok\u00e9mon myself? W-well, er, it\u2019s certainly not because I\u2019m scared!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_4": "Y-you see I would, but I\u2019m busy here with some...uh...research! Yes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_5": "Oh! I think I see Blanche over there near my lab. Maybe it\u2019s time for some research into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_0_6": "Could you go on ahead and let me know what you find, %PLAYERNAME%? Thanks\u2014and good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_0": "Blanche, do you really think this Galarian Pok\u00e9mon can evolve? Oh, glad to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014 AH!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_1": "What\u2019s that sound?! Oh, it\u2019s just a Yamask. Seems like it\u2019s looking at its mask and crying.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_2": "Ah, so Yamask was the unusual Pok\u00e9mon appearing in the forest? I see. Sorry, Trainer, but it looks like you\u2019re going to have to venture back out there.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_3": "After comparing eyewitness reports with some texts I found about Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon, it turns out we aren\u2019t looking for this particular kind of Yamask, which was originally discovered in the Unova region, but another one entirely!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_4": "The Yamask we\u2019re looking for was first discovered in the Galar region and seems to be carrying a clay slab. The texts say that the slab absorbs that Yamask\u2019s dark power.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_1_5": "Unfortunately, I can\u2019t come along with you this time, either. Because, uh...it looks like Spark needs my help with some Strange Eggs! See ya later, and good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_0": "Yup, still seems like mostly Poison- and Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon are hatching from Strange Eggs. I sure am glad we got to confirm what we already\u2014 Oh!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_1": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! How are\u2014 EGAD! A Spiritomb! What a tricky Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_2": "I\u2019ve worked with Trainers to research Spiritomb in previous years. Maybe you\u2019ve encountered a Spiritomb before!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_3": "There seem to be a few more Spiritomb around than in the past. That\u2019s quite frightening, given that each Spiritomb is formed by 108 spirits bound to a keystone.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_4": "One might say that it\u2019s BOUND to be a real spooky season! Haha, sorry, Spiritomb\u2014too much?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_5": "Anyway, I hate to ask you again, Trainer, but third time\u2019s the charm, right? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll encounter the illusive and elusive Galarian Yamask this time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_2_6": "I, uh, have to go help Candela prep for an upcoming Trainer Battle, but you go on ahead! Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_0": "Poison-, Bug-, Ghost-, Dark-, and Fairy-type Pok\u00e9mon\u2014looks like you\u2019re all set for a spooky Trainer Battle, Candela!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_1": "Oh, hi there, %PLAYERNAME%! And hello, Galarian Yamask! What a curious Pok\u00e9mon this is. It gives off a totally different energy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_2": "Blanche and I were looking into the Evolution of Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon earlier, and it appears that Galarian Yamask evolves into an entirely different Pok\u00e9mon than its counterpart from Unova does!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_3": "All you need is to collect some Yamask Candies and get to evolving! I\u2019m certain that its Evolution will be an exciting addition to your Pok\u00e9dex!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_4": "Anyway, I\u2019m so glad we got to go on this spooky adventure and discover Galarian Yamask together!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hallowyamas_3_5": "I hope you had a ghoulishly good time, and I hope you have an extra spoOoOoOoOoOoky day!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Quite an eventful few months we\u2019ve had, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_1": "How are things with Hoopa? You two seem to get along great from what I can tell.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_2": "I suspect its trust in you must have deepened after you protected it from Team GO Rocket.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_3": "While you and Hoopa have been out adventuring together, my research into the mystery surrounding Hoopa has taken some strange turns.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_4": "I was up late poring over my notes recently when I heard a knock at the door of my mobile lab. I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting anyone, but I figured it would be rude not to answer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_5": "As I approached the door, I heard something scurrying away, and when I opened it, I found nothing but a curious bottle at my feet.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_6": "There was a note attached. I\u2019ve managed to decipher only part of it, but here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got so far.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_0_7": "\u201cOffer sweets and dust you\u2019ve found \nSo Hoopa\u2019s form will be unbound",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_10": "Hoopa Unbound is said to be tremendously powerful\u2014but I think you can handle it, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_11": "It\u2019s been a long adventure with Hoopa, but I think we\u2019ve finally reached the end.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_12": "It\u2019s almost bittersweet, don\u2019t you think? But fret not\u2014I\u2019m sure more discoveries await!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_13": "Let\u2019s keep adventuring through this world full of mysteries\u2014you, me, and Hoopa!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_8": "Of course, this is all just a theory.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoopaunbound_2_9": "We\u2019ll have to test it before reaching any proper conclusions!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_1": "I just saw the most wonderful thing: hundreds of Hoppip are filling the sky! You\u2019d think the clouds were pink with how many there are out there right now.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_2": "I believe this is the perfect opportunity for us to learn more about Hoppip, the Cottonweed Pok\u00e9mon, don\u2019t you agree?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_3": "It\u2019s said that when Hoppip gather in fields and mountains, spring is on the way.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_0_4": "Does it feel like spring yet, with all these Hoppip floating about? Let\u2019s see about catching a few to find out more about them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_0": "Wow, look at all those Hoppip! Hoppip are so light that they grip the ground with their feet to keep from being blown away. They also like to huddle up and link their leaves to stay grounded as a group.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_1": "They sure have found all sorts of clever ways to keep themselves in place.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_1_2": "Hoppip can also evolve, and it\u2019s quite the sight. Don\u2019t take my word for it\u2014how about you go see for yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_0": "What an adorable Skiploom, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you had a moment to study it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_1": "The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates. Because Skiploom\u2019s flower blossoms when the temperature rises, some Trainers have taken to using it as a thermometer. Isn\u2019t that fascinating?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_2": "In warm weather, Skiploom can also be seen floating in the air to get closer to the sun. I don\u2019t blame it\u2014if I could float and get a little more sunlight, I would, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_2_3": "Did you know that Skiploom can evolve as well? Why don\u2019t you evolve one, hm?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you\u2019ve got yourself a Jumpluff. Jumpluff rides the winds to cross the sea and fly to foreign lands, scattering cotton spores as it goes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_1": "Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful to travel so breezily?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_2": "On that note, you should take your new friend for a stroll\u2014maybe bask in the sunlight together a bit, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_hoppt_3_3": "See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_0": "Jessie: Hey, James, did you hear?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_1": "James: What is it, Jessie?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_2": "Jessie: Apparently, there\u2019s a mysterious Pok\u00e9mon in a jungle nearby!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_3": "James: Go on!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_5": "James: Oh? That sounds like the kind of Pok\u00e9mon the Boss would be happy to see!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_6": "Jessie: It\u2019s going to be a pain, though, since we don\u2019t really know the area.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_7": "James: Hmmm, maybe we can con someone into helping us!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_8": "Jessie: Yeah... Huh? Hey, you! You must be an assistant the Boss sent! Yeah, why else would someone be out here in the middle of nowhere?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_0_9": "James: Assistant? Oh! Of course! An assistant! The Boss has high expectations for us, after all. Now that you\u2019re here, let\u2019s get to work.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_0": "Jessie: Nice work, kid! I can\u2019t believe you actually did it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_1": "James: Yeah! It feels nice to have somebody to boss around\u2014 I mean, uh, somebody to help us out! Jessie and I are constantly on our feet, you know.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_2": "Jessie: As you can imagine, it\u2019s hard for us to maintain our good looks when we\u2019re always running around like this. Anyway, you did your bit, so I guess we can let you take a little break.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_3": "James: Superb idea, Jessie! It\u2019s important to change up the pace every once in a while!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_1_4": "James: Go on and spend some time with your buddy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_0": "Jessie: I\u2019m so glad the Boss sent along someone so useful to help us!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_1": "James: Now that you mention it, you haven\u2019t told us anything about yourself. Where are you normally stationed? How long have you been with Team Rocket? Oh, what\u2019s your favorite thing about the Boss? Do tell!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_10": "James: Hey, who exactly are you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_11": "James: ... ... ...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_12": "Jessie: You\u2019d better start talking.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_13": "Jessie: Aha! I knew you were just a no-good Twerp! This whole thing was suspicious from the start! Did someone send you to get in our way?! Yeah, that must be it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_14": "James: I trusted you! I thought you were one of us!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_15": "Jessie: You know too much! We can\u2019t let you go! Let\u2019s get \u2019em, James!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_16": "James: Don\u2019t you dare get in our way! You\u2019ll regret it if you do!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_17": "Jessie: Don\u2019t you know who we are?! Well, let us formally introduce ourselves!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_18": "Jessie: Prepare for trouble...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_19": "James: And make it double!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_2": "Jessie: ...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_20": "Jessie: To protect the world from devastation!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_21": "James: To unite all people\u2014 HEY! Are you even listening?!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_3": "James: Hey, why so quiet all of a sudden?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_4": "James: Jessie, who actually told you that we\u2019d be getting an assistant?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_5": "Jessie: Nobody told ME anything!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_6": "James: Well, no one told me, either!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_7": "Jessie: But you\u2019re the one who said they were sent by the Boss!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_8": "James: I said no such thing!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_2_9": "James: ... ... ...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_0": "Jessie: I can\u2019t believe we were defeated by a Twerp like you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_1": "James: That was totally unexpected. What will the Boss say...?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_2": "James: Huh?!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_3": "Jessie: Hey, behind you! Isn\u2019t that Celebi? Could it be the so-called Protector of the Jungle?!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_4": "James: Drat! That Pok\u00e9mon was supposed to be ours!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_5": "Jessie: Mark our words...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_jj_3_6": "James: We\u2019ll get you next time!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_1": "I have an exciting discovery to share with you today. Have you heard of the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_2": "Well, it looks like they\u2019ve been challenging Trainers in Raid Battles recently!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_3": "Coming face-to-face with any Legendary Pok\u00e9mon is cause to celebrate, but I\u2019m extra intrigued this time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_4": "Why, you ask? Well, Spark said he saw something peculiar along the waterfront while he was taking pictures earlier\u2014a Pok\u00e9mon running across the water\u2019s surface!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_5": "But the photos he captured are, ah... Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s hard to tell what exactly is in them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_6": "Do you think this could be connected to the appearance of those Legendary Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_0_7": "This calls for more research. How about you document your findings with some GO Snapshots? We might be on the trail of something extraordinary!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_0": "Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. Your research will help us dive a bit deeper into what\u2019s currently going on.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_1": "Since the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon we discussed previously have been testing Trainers\u2019 skills in raids, I consulted with Candela, the authority on all things related to battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_2": "She thinks the current situation points to the Colt Pok\u00e9mon, Keldeo, making an appearance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_3": "Candela is a bona fide expert on Keldeo, you see.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_4": "She said that Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion taught this Pok\u00e9mon how to fight and that it dashes across the world, seeking opportunities to further its training.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_5": "No wonder Candela is such a big fan! It\u2019s clear that Keldeo has the drive to improve itself and the passion to accomplish whatever it sets its mind to doing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_1_6": "Why don\u2019t we take some inspiration from Keldeo and do some training? With such a battle-hardened Pok\u00e9mon around, we can\u2019t be too prepared.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_1": "While you were battling away, Blanche and I had a moment to dig into some texts and learn more about Keldeo.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_2": "Evidently, Keldeo is considered part of a powerful group of Pok\u00e9mon from the Unova region that includes Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_3": "This confirms a link between their appearance and Spark\u2019s sighting near the waterfront.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_4": "It\u2019s said that Keldeo must survive harsh battles and fully develop the horn on its forehead before its true power will awaken.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_2_5": "Hm. I wonder what this \u201ctrue power\u201d might be. Let\u2019s investigate the relationship between power and Pok\u00e9mon by...well, powering up and evolving some Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_0": "It\u2019s all starting to come together. I think it\u2019s now safe to say our mysterious visitor is indeed the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Keldeo!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_1": "Blanche and I found more information, too. For starters, Keldeo actually has two forms, one of which is called its \u201cOrdinary Form.\u201d",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_2": "What\u2019s more, Keldeo can glide across water by blasting water from its hooves\u2014and it excels at using leg moves while battling!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_3": "This corroborates both Spark\u2019s sighting and Candela\u2019s knowledge of this Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_3_4": "I think I\u2019ll contact them and propose a trip to the waterfront to see if we can gather more information firsthand. Stay tuned!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_0": "That was quite the field trip, %PLAYERNAME%, but I bear good news!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_1": "The team leaders and I came across fresh Keldeo tracks near the waterfall in Spark\u2019s picture!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_2": "Spark, Blanche, and Candela all wanted to the be first to meet the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, so they\u2019re battling it out to decide who gets the honor.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_3": "And then there\u2019s you. Given what a great Pok\u00e9mon Trainer you are, I reckon you and Keldeo could achieve some truly marvelous feats together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_4_4": "Not to undermine our friends, but why don\u2019t you head out with your buddy to see if you can encounter it first?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_5_0": "Amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve caught the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Keldeo!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_5_1": "What an incredible discovery. Thank you for all your help as we followed those clues to their extraordinary end.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_5_2": "Whoa! I can feel Keldeo\u2019s determination to train from here. This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s full of drive, just like you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_5_3": "Don\u2019t keep it waiting\u2014feel free to give yourselves a workout by taking Keldeo to battle other Trainers!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_6_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I can tell that Keldeo enjoyed getting stronger with you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_6_1": "The team leaders and I are so proud of all the work you\u2019re doing to grow as a Trainer. This only adds to the list of your accomplishments.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_6_2": "And with enough time and training, perhaps we\u2019ll be able to see Keldeo\u2019s other form one day. I\u2019ll keep a blank page in my research notebook ready\u2014no, several pages!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_keldeo_6_3": "Haha. I suppose that marks the end of this adventure, but you\u2019ll be hearing from me soon, %PLAYERNAME%. Until then, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Impeccable timing. I was getting ready to go look for you. There\u2019s something I\u2019d like your help investigating.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_1": "This morning, Meltan and I were taking a walk along one of our favorite routes when I noticed that a hill we always pass by seemed...smaller than usual.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_2": "There\u2019s only one possibility\u2014Team GO Rocket\u2019s started LITERALLY moving mountains to get their hands on Pok\u00e9mon! Those scoundrels!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_3": "Well, whatever they\u2019re scheming, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t nip in the bud. Good luck out there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_4": "... ... ...\nHaha! I\u2019m only pulling your leg. In truth, I suspect a Pok\u00e9mon is responsible.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_0_5": "Take a look around and see if you spot a Pok\u00e9mon that could be our mountain-moving culprit, would you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_1": "Judging from the Pok\u00e9mon with you, it looks like our mountain-mover must be Larvitar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_2": "This intrepid Pok\u00e9mon is born deep underground.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_3": "To come up to the surface, it needs to eat its way through the soil above. It can\u2019t see its parents\u2019 faces until it does.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_4": "That\u2019s hard work for a newborn, but its tough spirit\u2019s something to admire.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_1_5": "I\u2019ll bet that spirit endures in its evolved form, Pupitar. Let\u2019s observe one ourselves, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_0": "Whoa! I thought I saw something shooting past, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_1": "Maybe it was another of those shooting stars I keep seeing...but maybe it was your Pupitar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_2": "Pupitar can\u2019t wait to evolve, so it relieves its stress by wildly propelling itself around using compressed gas\u2014almost like a rocket!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_3": "Plus, its shell is as hard as sheet rock. Its thrashing can topple a mountain, believe it or not!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_4": "Some think of Pupitar as a troublesome Pok\u00e9mon, but I can relate to its desire to grow.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_5": "I know sometimes I\u2019m in a rush to find all the answers and \u201cevolve\u201d my knowledge. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve gotten into more than one scrape.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_6": "But even when you\u2019re growing, it\u2019s good to appreciate where you are in life. That goes for you too, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_2_7": "Next, let\u2019s take a look at the Pok\u00e9mon Pupitar is so eager to evolve into!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_0": "I thought I felt an earthquake, but it was just your Tyranitar walking around, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_1": "And look how powerful it\u2019s become\u2014from its humble beginnings burrowing up through the earth to making the surface shake with every stomp.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_2": "In fact, Tyranitar is so overwhelmingly powerful that it can bring down a whole mountain to make its nest.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_3": "It\u2019s also known to wander about in mountain ranges looking for new opponents to fight.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_4": "Luckily, Tyranitar will ignore opponents it doesn\u2019t consider worthy. I\u2019m probably safe!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_5": "But it does make you wonder how they\u2019re able to gauge an opponent\u2019s strength.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_6": "Hmm... Maybe you\u2019ll get some insight on that as you travel with Tyranitar.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_7": "And if you do, be sure to let your favorite professor know! In any case, congratulations on befriending yet another mighty Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_larvitar_cdc_3_8": "Thanks for an exciting day of research, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll see you again soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! You know, I had an odd dream the other night... I was spitting fire!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_1": "Then the strangest coincidence happened\u2014when I woke up, there were more Litten around than usual!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_2": "I\u2019d love to observe them more closely, but it takes time to get them to trust you, so it\u2019s easier said than done.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_3": "But I bet with that spark and determination of yours, you just might be able to get some of them to warm up to you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_0": "Color me impressed! It\u2019s amazing that you managed to gain their trust so quickly.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_1": "For my part, I just can\u2019t help smothering Litten with attention\u2014though I\u2019m sure they\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_2": "How do I know? Because if you try too hard to get close to one, it won\u2019t open up to you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_3": "Tell you what\u2014why don\u2019t you try evolving Litten into Torracat, then fill me in on what you learn in the process of building your friendship.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_0": "Brilliant work, Trainer! Let\u2019s have a look at your fiery new Torracat.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_1": "Take a peek at its throat\u2014see that bell of flame? It rings brightly whenever Torracat spits fire.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_2": "It also boasts powerful front legs. With a single punch, it can bend an iron bar right over!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_3": "How about we help this fur-ocious fighter burn even brighter?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_0": "Whew! Why do I feel like I\u2019m about to melt?! Oh\u2014you\u2019ve evolved your Torracat into Incineroar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_1": "Did you know the temperature of the flames from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit? And that\u2019s not all!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_2": "Incineroar is equally formidable when it\u2019s hurling ferocious punches or flinging furious kicks! Speaking of formidable, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014you\u2019ve really evolved into quite the Trainer yourself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_3": "I can\u2019t wait to see how much further you\u2019ll go. Until next time, keep that fire of yours burning hot!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Is it just me, or is there a ghostly chill in the air?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_1": "It could have something to do with those lights over there! They belong to Litwick, the Candle Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_2": "Litwick is known to leech off the life force of any who follow it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_3": "The younger the life this Pok\u00e9mon absorbs, the brighter and eerier the flame on its head burns. Makes for a pretty ominous candle, wouldn\u2019t you say?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_4": "Litwick appearing in such force makes the perfect chance to learn more about them. I suggest you get up close and see for yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_0_5": "Just be careful not to let Litwick lead you anywhere, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_0": "Good day, Trainer. Professor Willow has tasked you with investigating...Litwick, is it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_1": "The flame on its head is certainly alluring. A Pok\u00e9mon that can bring light to its surroundings\u2026 What could be the source of its brilliant glow?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_2": "\u201cLife force,\u201d Professor Willow says? Peculiar. I wonder\u2014would those flames transform if Litwick were to evolve?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_1_3": "What are your thoughts, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_0": "Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! You went looking for Litwick and came back with a lamp! ",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_1": "I kid\u2014I know a Lampent when I see one! And it was Rhi who suggested you help Litwick evolve? That\u2019s great. We can always learn more when encouraged by our friends!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_2": "So, let me tell you about Lampent! While it often pretends to be a lamp, Lampent is usually feared as an emissary of death. ",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_3": "Through cities it wanders, searching for the spirits of the fallen. Spooky, but appropriate for the season! ",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_4": "And what a sight that fire is. I\u2019m sure you and Rhi would get a kick out of seeing Lampent\u2019s Evolution, Chandelure, too! But a word of caution, %PLAYERNAME%...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_2_5": "They say spirits burned up in Chandelure's ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_0": "That new Pok\u00e9mon...\n... ... ...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_1": "Oh. My apologies, %PLAYERNAME%. I was...preoccupied gazing at the flame your Pok\u00e9mon is emanating.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_2": "... ... ...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_3": "The swaying of its arms is rather hypnotic.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_4": "It's called \"Chandelure,\" is it? And Professor Willow said its flames can burn up spirits? An unsettling thought.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_5": "The Pok\u00e9mon we studied today could easily be seen as frightening. Yet I believe there is a lesson we can take from them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_6": "No matter how dark the world becomes, a little light always persists.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_litwick_3_7": "Thank you for teaching me that lesson once again, %PLAYERNAME%. Take care, and I will see you again.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lny_feb23_1_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Guess what? I was observing a herd of Ponyta last night, and I saw a shooting star! Or maybe it was a spark from fighting Shinx?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lny_feb23_1_1": "In any case, it looks like it was a lucky star\u2014I wished you\u2019d turn up today, and here you are!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lny_feb23_1_2": "Now it\u2019s your turn. What do you wish to research today, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Can I just say how impressed I am with your progress as a Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_1": "You\u2019ve really put in the time and effort to become one of the very best. Well done!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_2": "Say, do you remember when we first met? You were just a beginner back then, and I sent you off to catch your very first Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_3": "And look at you now! I\u2019m glad we can share that memory together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_4": "Now, I\u2019m sure an elite Trainer like yourself has mastered the art of catching Pok\u00e9mon, but it\u2019s important to keep your skills sharp.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_5": "How about you head out and catch some Pok\u00e9mon? I\u2019ve assigned some tasks that should challenge even a Trainer of your caliber.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_0_6": "Good luck\u2014and have fun!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_0": "Great work as always, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_1": "I\u2019m sure those tasks were a breeze for someone with your skills, but they were just a warm-up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_2": "These next tasks should prove a bit more challenging.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_3": "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve built special bonds with several Pok\u00e9mon over the course of your adventures. You might even have a few Pok\u00e9mon that you like to always bring into battles.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_4": "I\u2019d like to see how powerful those bonds are. Why don\u2019t you head out, challenge a few Team GO Rocket Grunts, and battle in some raids?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_5": "After all, the best Trainers never stop training!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_1_6": "Good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_0": "How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_1": "I\u2019m sure you had a great time working with your closest Pok\u00e9mon companions.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_2": "It\u2019s always fascinating to see how Trainers and Pok\u00e9mon work together, and I can tell that you take a lot of pride in training your team. Well done!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_3": "Say, why don\u2019t you evolve some of the Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve caught so they can reach their full potential? You might even discover some new options for battles.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_4": "Enough about that, though\u2014back to our research!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_5": "This next batch will test your Pok\u00e9mon-catching skills again, but with a twist. Or perhaps I should say a curve? Haha! That\u2019s right\u2014you\u2019ll need to test your skills with Curveball Throws!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_2_6": "Make sure to stretch your throwing arm!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_0": "Nice work, Trainer! I can tell you put a lot of effort into that research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_1": "I have Blanche assisting me with the analysis and care of all those Pok\u00e9mon you sent over. It\u2019s an impressive display of your progress, Trainer, and it\u2019s caught Blanche\u2019s eye as well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_2": "Anyway, I should probably get back to work.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_3": "But before I go, I want to say how nice it was to reminisce about our first memories as professor and Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_4": "I\u2019m truly proud of you and how much you\u2019ve grown!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_5": "I know you\u2019re far from finished on that front, too, so I\u2019ll be watching closely as you progress and checking in whenever I have more challenges for you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_43_3_6": "Until then, %PLAYERNAME%...let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wanted to check in on your progress. It looks like you\u2019ve grown even more as a Trainer since we last spoke!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_1": "As for me, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with my Buddy Pok\u00e9mon lately, and it\u2019s helped me think of some new research opportunities.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_2": "Do you remember your first Buddy Pok\u00e9mon? I remember mine\u2014it was the mysterious Hex Nut Pok\u00e9mon Meltan!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_3": "I still remember the day it earned its very own Best Buddy ribbon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_4": "That\u2019s a proud moment in any Trainer\u2019s journey, don\u2019t you think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_5": "Meltan and I have been around the block a few times, but I still look forward to the next Pok\u00e9Stop we\u2019ll visit.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_0_6": "Why don\u2019t you and your buddy go out and visit some of your favorite places together?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_0": "Hope you enjoyed a few walks together with your buddy, Trainer. Did you come across any interesting Pok\u00e9Stops?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_1": "I was inspired to head outdoors myself. I joined Spark and his buddy for a long walk after he won a battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_2": "I even took a celebratory snapshot to mark the occasion!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_3": "Going on walks together can be a great way to strengthen your bond with your Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s also a wonderful form of exercise!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_4": "Seeing the bond Spark shares with his Pok\u00e9mon gave me some ideas for more research. Oh, and Spark also wanted me to let you know that he\u2019s cheering you on!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_5": "How about you and your buddy go out for a walk, challenge another Trainer and their Pok\u00e9mon to battle, and take a few snapshots to capture some fun moments together?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_1_6": "Working hard is important, but so is savoring the memories made along the way! Have fun!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_0": "Did you make any fun memories with your Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_1": "I\u2019m always amazed by the variety in the snapshots taken by Trainers from all over the world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_2": "I\u2019m especially fond of ones that capture surprise encounters with Pok\u00e9mon like Smeargle!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_3": "That\u2019s one of the best parts of taking snapshots\u2014you never know what you\u2019re going to see!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_4": "Hmm... That reminds me of when Team GO Rocket decided to start showing up in Trainers\u2019 snapshots uninvited. And THAT reminds me of some more research I need your help with!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_5": "To start, why don\u2019t you and your buddy get warmed up with some raids? When you\u2019re ready, I think we\u2019ll need some help clearing out the Team GO Rocket Leaders in the area.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_2_6": "They\u2019re always up to something, so it\u2019s good to keep an eye out in case they try to take over any nearby Pok\u00e9Stops. Good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_0": "Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_1": "The Team GO Rocket Leaders are a challenge for most Trainers, but I knew they wouldn\u2019t stand a chance against you and your Buddy Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_2": "The power of friendship is strong indeed\u2014and just one of many benefits to building relationships with your Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_3": "The trust between a Trainer and their Pok\u00e9mon is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Make sure to cherish it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_4": "I\u2019m glad I was able to check in on your progress, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_5": "I\u2019ll be back with more fun challenges as you continue your journey.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_45_3_6": "Until next time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_1": "I can see you\u2019ve been working as hard as ever!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_2": "We\u2019ve been doing a lot of reminiscing lately, haven\u2019t we? I think it\u2019s important to look back on your accomplishments from time to time\u2014especially when you\u2019ve accomplished so much!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_3": "A major moment for many Trainers is their first victory in battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_4": "It\u2019s an unforgettable thrill that comes with a swell of pride for the Pok\u00e9mon that sealed the victory.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_5": "How about you, %PLAYERNAME%? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got some epic battle stories to share with your fellow Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_0_6": "I\u2019d like to focus on your battling skills for this next challenge. So to prepare, why don\u2019t you get your team sorted and get in some throwing practice?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_0": "You clearly have some powerful Pok\u00e9mon, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_1": "You\u2019ve done an amazing job training them! I wanted to see how your battling skills have progressed, so I consulted with Candela to get her thoughts.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_2": "I\u2019m happy to report that she\u2019s just as proud of you as I am!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_3": "For this next challenge, she suggested taking on some of her most difficult opponents\u2014Team GO Rocket and its leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_4": "The Team GO Rocket Leaders can be intimidating, so Candela asked me to pass along some extra guidance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_5": "She said that when it comes to battling, you should take on your opponents with a cool head, strong Pok\u00e9mon, and a heart full of passion.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_1_6": "With that in mind, I think it\u2019s time for you to head out and put your skills to the test!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your battling skills are even more impressive than the last time we talked.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_1": "Those skills are vital not only when you take on Team GO Rocket but also when you battle in raids. Do you remember your first raid, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_2": "To me, there\u2019s something special about a group of Trainers coming together to challenge a raid with their partner Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_3": "There\u2019s no questioning the importance of the bonds Trainers share with their Pok\u00e9mon, but I think the bonds Trainers share with their peers are equally important.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_4": "No matter your skill level, what team you\u2019re on, or the Pok\u00e9mon you bring to battle, raids are about each Trainer working together to achieve a common goal. And that\u2019s what the Trainer community is all about!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_5": "I hope that inspired you to head out and challenge some raids with your fellow Trainers\u2014because that\u2019s part of your next task!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_2_6": "It should be a fun challenge, so be sure to give it your best shot!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_0": "Excellent work, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_1": "Did you enjoy spending time with your fellow Trainers as you completed your tasks?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_2": "Hopefully you even found a Pok\u00e9mon that\u2019ll make a great addition to your team!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_3": "I hope you continue making memories with Trainers from all over as you work together and explore this amazing world filled with Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_4": "Very few Trainers have made it as far as you have. Be sure to take a moment to celebrate your progress.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_5": "And remember\u2014the journey is just as important as the destination!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_48_3_6": "Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_0": "I knew I\u2019d see you here before long, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_1": "But before we begin this challenge, let\u2019s take a couple deep breaths together, shall we?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_2": "In... And out... One more time. In... And out... There, that\u2019s better.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_3": "A few deep breaths go a long way when you need to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand\u2014and you\u2019ll need plenty of focus for what I\u2019ll be throwing your way next.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_4": "Get it? \u201cThrowing\u201d? Ahem! Anyway... The sign of a truly great Trainer is their dedication to training, and true dedication takes time to prove.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_5": "Your next few tasks will take some time to complete, but don\u2019t worry. Start with a deep breath, and be sure to enjoy yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_0_6": "Training can be hard work, but don\u2019t forget it\u2019s supposed to be fun, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_0": "Impressive work, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_1": "I don\u2019t know many who would have the dedication and patience to complete those tasks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_2": "Say, I was just thinking... Do you remember when you decided which team you wanted to join?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_3": "Trainers often form a strong connection to their team and become dedicated members. Others, however, eventually look to change teams in hopes of gaining a different perspective and a fresh challenge.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_4": "Everyone\u2019s path is different, and I\u2019ll always encourage you to find your own. There\u2019s much to be learned from Team Instinct, Team Mystic, and Team Valor. Each team has its own unique characteristics and focus.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_5": "I urge you to learn from your fellow Trainers and respect their paths. It\u2019s sure to help you become a better Trainer! After all, only when we understand others can we truly understand ourselves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_1_6": "Now, back to your research. I have a feeling this next batch will truly test your resolve, so take your time\u2014we\u2019ll regroup when you\u2019re finished!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_0": "Welcome back, Trainer. You certainly showed your dedication by completing those tasks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_1": "Which did you find most difficult? And which was most fun?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_2": "We\u2019re approaching the end of this challenge, and I\u2019m not ashamed to say it\u2019s making me a bit emotional! The team leaders and I feel an immense sense of pride when we see how much you\u2019ve grown.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_3": "I hope you feel that pride in yourself, %PLAYERNAME%. To wrap up this challenge, each team leader wanted you to experience some of their most beloved activities.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_4": "Spark wants you to enjoy a walk with your buddy to enhance your bond, and Blanche hopes to remind you of the importance of research and analysis by asking you to evolve some of your Pok\u00e9mon to their full potential.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_5": "As for Candela... Well, she wants to celebrate with you after you win some raids.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_2_6": "I think these are great tasks for a well-rounded Trainer like yourself. I\u2019ll be here to congratulate you when you\u2019re done!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_0": "Amazing. Simply amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! Let me be the first to congratulate you for completing this challenge. You\u2019ve become a truly top-class Trainer, and it\u2019s been an honor to work alongside you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_1": "It\u2019s been astonishing to witness the growth you\u2019ve experienced since you began your journey as a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. You\u2019re an incredible talent, and I hope you\u2019ll put your skills to use.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_2": "You see, I want you to help other Trainers become the best they can be. Your experience comes with a lot of responsibility, and I hope you\u2019ll continue to show kindness, patience, and friendship to those who could benefit from your guidance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_3": "The world of Pok\u00e9mon is a beautiful place, and I want you to lead by example and show everyone how amazing our community can be while protecting it from the likes of Team GO Rocket and anyone else who would threaten it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_4": "Remember how it felt the first time you caught a Pok\u00e9mon, the first time you took a walk with your buddy, the first time you challenged a raid\u2014and channel that energy into everything you do. With your strong heart and peerless determination, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_5": "I can only hope you\u2019re as proud of yourself as the team leaders and I are of you. Don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll always be here when you need me, and you can be sure I\u2019ll be calling on you from time to time to help me with research. There\u2019s always something more to discover, after all!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_lvl_50_3_6": "Thanks for everything, %PLAYERNAME%. I know I can always count on you! And I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m about to say, so before I get too choked up\u2014let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014perfect timing!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_1": "Come look at this. See that there, in the dirt?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_2": "That\u2019s right\u2014footprints! Though not human ones, I\u2019d wager.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_3": "You\u2019d be hard pressed to find shoes that would fit whatever feet made these, I think! There must be a Pok\u00e9mon responsible, though I\u2019m not sure which one...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_4": "I\u2019m going to stick around and see if I can\u2019t learn a bit more from these footprints, so why don\u2019t you follow them and see where they take you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_0_5": "Make sure to snap some photos of your findings!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! That Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon you caught looks spectacular.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_1": "Did you know that Drilbur, the Mole Pok\u00e9mon, can dig through the ground at incredible speeds?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_2": "In the Galar region, Drilbur often leave farmers in a tizzy because they damage their crops. Sounds like mole than they can handle, eh? Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_3": "Anyway, while you were out, I received reports that the Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019re looking for has vines on its body.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_1_4": "How about you search the bushes nearby to see if you can find any vines? Don\u2019t forget to snap some photos, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. You got a great shot of that Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_1": "I encountered a curious Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon myself, actually: Combee.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_2": "Known as the Tiny Bee Pok\u00e9mon, Combee is actually a trio! The three work together to collect honey and deliver it to their colony.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_3": "Such abundant teamwork sure is admirable!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_4": "I\u2019m sure our team leaders strive to achieve that same level of synergy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_5": "Anyway, the Combee I saw got me thinking: Maybe we\u2019ve been searching too close to the ground. If my hypothesis is correct, we\u2019re on the trail of a Pok\u00e9mon that can sometimes be seen hopping from tree to tree.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_2_6": "This time, try searching among the trees to see if you can find any leads. And don\u2019t forget to photograph your findings!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Sweet Nuzleaf.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_1": "I believe the Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019re after tends to live deep in forests\u2014much like Nuzleaf does\u2014so we should be on the right track.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_2": "Ah, look\u2014your Nuzleaf just started playing its grass flute!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_3": "The sound of it is said to make its listeners uneasy. I wonder if it\u2019s trying to lead the Pok\u00e9mon out into the open...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_4": "Wait, what was that?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_3_5": "Look there! A dark shadow just dashed across the sky! Keep your eyes up, %PLAYERNAME%, and chase after it! Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_0": "Great job out there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_1": "The photo you sent me speaks to your efforts. And I see you made a new friend in that Rufflet!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_2": "Did you know that Rufflet will challenge Pok\u00e9mon stronger than itself, even if it might lose? That\u2019s how it pushes itself to grow!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_3": "Pretty brave, huh? I think bravery is exactly what we\u2019ll need as we prepare to encounter the mysterious Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019ve been tracking.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_4": "Thanks to all the information we\u2019ve gathered, I\u2019m certain that we\u2019re dealing with Zarude, the Rogue Monkey Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_5": "The Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Zarude tend to live in packs in the forest, but it looks like the one we\u2019ve been following is all on its own.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_6": "Sounds like the perfect chance to catch it, don\u2019t you think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_m23_2021_4_7": "With everything we\u2019ve learned\u2014and all the Pok\u00e9mon friends you\u2019ve made along the way\u2014I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll succeed!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_0": "...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_1": "Oh! %PLAYERNAME%, you caught me by surprise. I was just thinking about some movies I\u2019ve seen recently.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_2": "What, you didn\u2019t take me for a movie guy? Haha! Well, while the world of Pok\u00e9mon is my greatest passion, I\u2019ve been trying to explore my interests outside of research and Pok\u00e9mon as well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_3": "Self-discovery is important for personal growth in all walks of life. It can also be quite fun! I\u2019ve learned that I really enjoy watching a film to pass the time now and again.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_4": "Also, a lot of movies feature Pok\u00e9mon! Don\u2019t you love it when your interests overlap?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_5": "I saw an incredibly thrilling action movie the other day. It was about a fighter who, against all odds, becomes a professional boxer alongside his trusty Machop.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_6": "Life had him on the ropes, but he just kept punching back! Talk about inspiring.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_7": "Did you know that Machop love to work out and build their muscles? They\u2019re never satisfied, even when they train hard all day long! I wish I had that energy when I do fieldwork!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_8": "Speaking of Machop: Did you notice that more of them are appearing in the wild? That\u2019s what reminded me of that movie in the first place!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_0_9": "Could you head out and learn more about Machop?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Great job catching all those Machop. I wonder if you\u2019ll grow as close as the two characters in that movie.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_1": "The main character started in a pretty tough place, but his Machop kept him motivated and inspired.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_2": "Then, he was given an incredible opportunity to compete against other fighters. My favorite part was when his Machop evolved into Machoke!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_3": "Isn\u2019t the relationship between a Trainer and their Pok\u00e9mon wonderful? Machoke are truly remarkable Pok\u00e9mon, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_4": "A Machoke\u2019s muscular body is so powerful, the Pok\u00e9mon must wear a power-save belt to regulate its motions.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_1_5": "As it happens, you should have enough Machop Candies now to evolve Machop into a Machoke of your own. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re living out that movie yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_0": "Wow\u2014that\u2019s one muscular Machoke! Great work evolving it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_1": "Sometimes, Machoke will head to fields and mountains to exercise and train. Isn\u2019t that dedication amazing?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_2": "It reminds me of a training montage in that film. The Trainer and his Machoke traveled to the mountains to train together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_3": "Watching their friendship blossom almost moved me to tears! The way they encouraged each other reminded me why I love Pok\u00e9mon, especially when the Machoke evolved into Machamp!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_4": "Oops, there I go again\u2026 Anyway, Machop and Machoke are very impressive Pok\u00e9mon, but Machamp is on an entirely different level.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_5": "Its four arms react more quickly than it can think, so Machamp can execute several punches at once!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_6": "Hoo-hah! That was the movie Machamp\u2019s signature move. Haha, who knew I\u2019d become such a film buff? Get it? Buff?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_7": "Moving right along\u2026",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_2_8": "How about you do a bit of research on Machamp? Your Machoke seems pumped to get stronger. Let\u2019s try evolving it into Machamp and see what happens!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_0": "Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you approaching with your newly evolved Machamp, and I almost couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. It was just like the end of that movie!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_1": "The Trainer ended up winning the tournament, and he couldn\u2019t have done it without his Machamp by his side.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_2": "Movies are so powerful! Especially ones about Pok\u00e9mon and their Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_3": "I suppose you and Machamp don\u2019t need to watch that particular film, though\u2014you practically lived it today! It\u2019s been inspiring to witness, and I hope to carry that inspiration with me as I grow closer to my own Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_4": "You never know what you\u2019ll discover about yourself when you try new things\u2014just like how you never know which Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ll end up forming a lifelong friendship with until you catch them!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_macht_3_5": "Thanks for coming along with me on this journey, Trainer. I wish you and your Machamp well, and I\u2019ll see you next time. Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_0": "Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! Do you hear that sound?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_1": "All morning, I\u2019ve been hearing the distinct sound of splashing water. While somewhat relaxing, it\u2019s definitely not a normal thing to hear around the lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_2": "Upon further investigation, I noticed an increased number of Magikarp in the wild. It was quite the sight to see so many of them splashing about.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_3": "Guess it\u2019s time to GO fishing! Get it? Because Magikarp is the Fish Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_4": "Anyway, I think it\u2019ll be safe to approach Magikarp, as documentation indicates they\u2019re harmless.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_0_5": "However, I see potential in this Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s time to head out and investigate.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_0": "Great work, Trainer! While you were out, I did a bit of a refresher on Magikarp.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_1": "Did you know that some Magikarp can jump so high, they can leap over a mountain? Now that\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_2": "Also, while having a reputation for being worthless, this hardy Pok\u00e9mon can thrive in any body of water, regardless of how dirty or polluted the water might be.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_3": "I think Magikarp deserves a bit more credit, don\u2019t you think? Let\u2019s focus on evolving Magikarp, since doing so takes some effort.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_1_4": "Maybe you should try using Pinap Berries when trying to catch Magikarp. Not only are Pinap Berries tasty, but they\u2019re quite useful as well!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_0": "Good job, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks to the research you\u2019ve completed, it\u2019s time to evolve that Magikarp of yours!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_1": "Remember when I said that Magikarp is harmless? Well, that isn\u2019t the case with its evolved form, Gyarados.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_2": "Known as the Atrocious Pok\u00e9mon, Gyarados has a reputation for being destructive. Tales of its rampaging nature are consistent across all research materials we have on it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_3": "So much for being harmless, am I right? Of note, Gyarados is both Water- and Flying-type\u2014something you might not expect from its humble beginnings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_2_4": "Looks like you\u2019ll be adding a powerful Pok\u00e9mon to your team, but let\u2019s proceed with caution.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. Looks like all your efforts have paid off, and you\u2019ve got yourself a Gyarados.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_1": "I\u2019m sure this Pok\u00e9mon will be a great member of your team when battling other Trainers or even Team GO Rocket!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_2": "Even though Gyarados is known for being vicious and extremely aggressive, a talented Trainer such as yourself will be able to befriend and train it so it can meet its full potential.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_3": "I\u2019m excited to see what kinds of challenges you\u2019ll demolish together!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_4": "Just make sure that the demolition is limited to battles\u2014not entire cities.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magit_3_5": "Anyway, until next time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing. I\u2019ve just encountered something strange!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_1": "I\u2019ve been feeling a bit warm lately, so I walked to a nearby clearing to enjoy the cool breeze\u2014but the temperature seemed to rise as I arrived!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_2": "Curious, isn\u2019t it? I suspect it\u2019s the work of a certain Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_3": "There\u2019s one that\u2019s known to dislike cold areas so much, it\u2019ll blow scorching flames to heat up its surroundings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_4": "I believe there are large groups of this particular Pok\u00e9mon appearing all over the place right now.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_5": "Ah, you\u2019re wondering which Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019m talking about? I think I\u2019ll keep that to myself for now. But here\u2014I'll write it on this piece of paper, and we can check later to see if I was right!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_0_6": "Can you go investigate and let me know what you find? Thanks, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_1": "As promised, I\u2019ll now reveal my guess as to which Pok\u00e9mon is responsible for these recent temperature spikes. As you can see, I wrote down...Magmar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_2": "My intuition is pretty \u201clit,\u201d eh? Am I using that ri\u2014AH! Wow, that little fireball turned my paper straight to ash!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_3": "Anyway, it seems the cause of these irregular warm fronts is indeed Magmar, the Spitfire Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_4": "When it breathes deeply, heat waves form around its body, making it hard to see clearly. Isn\u2019t that just incredible?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_5": "And to think that this intimidating Pok\u00e9mon evolves from the adorable Magby, the Live Coal Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_6": "As adorable as Magby is, though, field studies have shown that whenever it inhales and exhales, hot embers dribble out of its mouth and nostrils. Still doesn\u2019t stop me from trying to hug it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_1_7": "Anyway, %PLAYERNAME%, you should try evolving your Magmar! Check in with me again before you do, though\u2014I\u2019ll have more hot tips for you then.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_0": "You\u2019re almost there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_1": "Soon, you\u2019ll have yourself a Magmortar, the Blast Pok\u00e9mon. Exciting stuff!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_2": "Watch out for the ends of its arms, though\u2014they can produce fireballs as hot as 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit! Yowch!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_3": "Can you imagine if you could blast fireballs out of your arms? Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Hahaha! Hey, that\u2019s pretty fun! Fwoosh!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_4": "There I go getting fired up about Pok\u00e9mon again. Get it? \u201cFired up\u201d? Haha, my hot streak continues!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_2_5": "Anyway, with this Sinnoh Stone and the Magmar Candy you\u2019ve acquired, you should be able to evolve your Magmar into Magmortar pretty soon\u2014so keep up the great work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you\u2019ve got your very own Magmortar.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_1": "Magmortar, like Magby and Magmar, tends to live in volcanos.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_2": "Its body can even take on a whitish hue from the intense heat generated by the fireballs it shoots from the ends of its arms!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_3": "Wow, learning about Magmar and its Evolutionary line has really lit a fire in my heart. I need to get back to my research, pronto!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_magmt_3_4": "See you around, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_0_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_0_1": "Is it just me, or are our surroundings looking...fluffier than usual today? It must be all these Mareep around!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_0_2": "Mareep might look tantalizingly soft, but a word of warning before you go in for a hug\u2014static electricity builds up in their fluffy coat, so touching one will give you quite a shock!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_0_3": "In lieu of a Mareep cuddle, how about a Mareep huddle? Let\u2019s put our heads together and see what we can learn about this wonderful Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_1": "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the Mareep you just caught.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_2": "Did you know that it stores air in its wool coat, allowing it to stay cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s cold?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_3": "In the warm months, its fleece is fully shed, but it grows back in a week.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_4": "Then, when cool weather blows in and brings dry air with it, Mareep\u2019s wool doubles in size and the tip of its tail glows slightly.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_1_5": "Say, why don\u2019t you help a few Mareep evolve so we can learn more about Flaaffy, too?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! Those are some happy-looking Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_1": "Flaaffy\u2019s fluffy fleece can store lots of electricity.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_2": "So much, in fact, that it has developed patches of rubbery skin that don\u2019t conduct electricity. This helps protect Flaaffy from being electrocuted.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_3": "Like Mareep, Flaaffy\u2019s tail is a great indicator of how much electric charge it has stored. When its coat is fully charged, its tail lights up.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_4": "Flaffy\u2019s Evolution, Ampharos, also has an impressive tail...but let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_2_5": "I\u2019ll tell you more about that after you\u2019ve helped Flaaffy evolve.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_0": "Wool-hoo, %PLAYERNAME%! That is one dazzling Ampharos!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_1": "Did you know the tip of Ampharos\u2019s tail shines so brightly that it can be seen from space? That\u2019s no tall tale! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_2": "This Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s light has been treasured by people since ancient times. It acts as a beacon for the lost\u2014and in the olden days, people used it to send signals back and forth across great distances.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_3": "It\u2019s no wonder Ampharos is known as the Light Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_4": "I just know it\u2019ll shine bright in all your wonderful adventures together, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mareep_3_5": "Thanks for spending the day learning with me. I\u2019ll see you next time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. How\u2019ve you been? Rested and relaxed, I hope?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_1": "I\u2019ve been full of energy since I saw Tapu Fini. And as I thought more about that encounter, I realized that over these past few months, we\u2019ve been seeing quite a few Pok\u00e9mon that were first found in Alola.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_2": "And you\u2014you\u2019ve even been lucky enough to see all four of Alola\u2019s island guardians!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_3": "I can\u2019t say I\u2019m completely free of envy, but I\u2019m glad you were able to have those experiences.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_4": "After all, we professors owe much of our learning to adventurous Trainers like yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_5": "I wonder if our friendship would be as fruitful if our roles were reversed... I\u2019d sure like to hope so! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_0_6": "Keep exploring, %PLAYERNAME%. You never know what you might find!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Look at that\u2014you\u2019ve caught all of Alola\u2019s first partner Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_1": "They make for quite the iconic trio.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_2": "Let\u2019s continue our Alola-inspired research today!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_1_3": "Which of Alola\u2019s islands piques your interest the most, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_0": "So you\u2019re interested in Melemele Island, eh? No surprise there\u2014it\u2019s one of my favorites as well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_1": "Though perhaps that isn\u2019t saying much... They\u2019re all my favorites, really! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_2": "As we\u2019ve discussed, Melemele Island is where many Trainers in Alola begin the region\u2019s island challenge.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_3": "There\u2019s even a Trainers\u2019 School there, where aspiring young Trainers can make friends and study up on all things Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2a_4": "In the spirit of Melemele Island, why don\u2019t you go meet some new Pok\u00e9mon and send some Gifts to your friends?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_0": "So you\u2019re interested in Akala Island, eh? No surprise there\u2014it\u2019s one of my favorites as well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_1": "Though perhaps that isn\u2019t saying much... They\u2019re all my favorites, really! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_2": "As I mentioned before, Akala Island offers a variety of geological features, including a volcano, fishing spots, and even waterfalls!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_3": "I like to take a stroll when my mind gets mired in a problem, and it sounds like Akala Island would be a great place for that.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2b_4": "In that spirit, why don\u2019t you take a stroll yourself? I\u2019ll be here when you get back.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_0": "So you\u2019re interested in Ula\u2019Ula Island, eh? No surprise there\u2014it\u2019s one of my favorites as well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_1": "Though perhaps that isn\u2019t saying much... They\u2019re all my favorites, really! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_2": "As we\u2019ve discussed, Ula\u2019Ula Island is home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in all of Alola! But did you know the summit of Mount Lanakila also houses Alola\u2019s very own Pok\u00e9mon League?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_3": "It\u2019s a place many Trainers aspire to reach, and doing so requires forging powerful bonds with Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2c_4": "In that spirit, why don\u2019t you head out and find some new Pok\u00e9mon partners, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_0": "So you\u2019re interested in Poni Island, eh? No surprise there\u2014it\u2019s one of my favorites as well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_1": "Though perhaps that isn\u2019t saying much... They\u2019re all my favorites, really! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_2": "Did you know that Poni Island is home to the Battle Tree, Alola\u2019s preeminent battle facility? Strong Trainers gather there to test their teams against each other.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_3": "I\u2019ve heard you can even meet some Pok\u00e9mon League Champions there on occasion! The things I could learn from them...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_2d_4": "In the spirit of Poni Island\u2014and as an act of public service\u2014why don\u2019t you test your battling skills against Team GO Rocket, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_1": "I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve had a great time getting to learn more about Alola, its Pok\u00e9mon, and even its guardian deities.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_2": "If there\u2019s one thing I love about Pok\u00e9mon, it\u2019s that there\u2019s always something new to learn!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_3": "But to be honest with you, I was hoping we\u2019d have a better idea by now of what attracted Alola\u2019s guardian deities here.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_4": "They usually spend their time protecting Alola, so what could\u2019ve spurred them to come here?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_5": "Could it be that they sensed something dangerous nearby that may threaten Alola? It would have to be something extraordinary\u2014maybe even beyond our current understanding of Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_6": "Another daunting yet fascinating question for us to tackle together, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_7": "Whatever comes next, I know the two of us will overcome it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_8": "For now, continue your island research. I\u2019ll keep trying to spot the guardian deities!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3_9": "I\u2019ll be in touch again soon. For now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3a_0": "Welcome back! Did your friends like their Gifts?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3b_0": "Welcome back! How was your adventure? Did you see anything new? You\u2019ll have to tell me all about it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3c_0": "Welcome back! Let me take a look at the Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve returned with... I bet with some training, you and your Pok\u00e9mon would be ready to take on Alola\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon League yourselves!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may22_alola_branch_quest_3d_0": "Welcome back! I knew you\u2019d have no trouble with Team GO Rocket. You never do!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_2": "... ... ... *sigh*",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_3": "Sorry. I\u2019ve just been feeling kinda burnt out lately.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_4": "I hate to say it, but my battling techniques have gotten stale. I need to reignite my inner fire somehow.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_5": "Wait\u2014I\u2019ve got an idea! Professor Willow\u2019s always talking about how great you are at Pok\u00e9mon battles.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_6": "How about letting me see some of that passion in action? Watching you battle might be just what I need!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_7": "You\u2019ll help me out, yeah? Nice. I knew you\u2019d agree, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_0_8": "Let\u2019s make sure our teams are in top shape, then we\u2019ll get to it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_0": "I\u2019m all set, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_1": "My team\u2019s raring to see you and your Pok\u00e9mon blaze into the fray!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_2": "So. Where should we start? There\u2019s plenty of options\u2014take on a Gym, battle with friends, go a couple rounds in the GO Battle League...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_3": "You and I could even go head-to-head!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_4": "Oh\u2014I\u2019ve got it! See that Team GO Rocket Grunt over there?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_1_5": "Let\u2019s take \u2019em down. We can save whatever Pok\u00e9mon they\u2019ve got their hands on and flex your battle skills at the same time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_0": "You\u2019re on fire, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_1": "Didja see how fast that Grunt ran off? Hah! You smoked \u2019em.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_2": "Speaking of Grunts, they\u2019ve been acting weird lately. The last few I battled acted off after I beat \u2019em. Usually they throw a huffy quip at me before sulking off.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_3": "But lately they just laugh!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_4": "Rrrgh... Think I need to up the intensity? Maybe have Ponyta give \u2019em a good Stomp at the end?!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_2_5": "Anyway. Enough analyzing\u2014that\u2019s Blanche\u2019s thing. Let\u2019s get back to battling. Why don\u2019t we find a Gym you can take on.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_0": "That was a blistering battle, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_1": "My mind\u2019s ablaze with new ways to train.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_2": "Thanks for helping me find my fire!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_3": "I should probably be the one teaching you stuff, but you know plenty already.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_4": "Does that mean you\u2019re looking to take up the reins of team leader yourself? Hah, I could get behind that!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_5": "You know, you really gave me the inspiration I needed\u2014I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty heroic.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_may23_candela_3_6": "All right. Enough talk. Ponyta and I are off to get in some training. See you later, %PLAYERNAME%! And you better be ready to battle the next time you see me.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I think I\u2019ve got an exciting adventure for you. I\u2019ve been working on something...BIG.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_1": "Recently, we observed a large number of Weedle appearing in the wild. I wanted to investigate that phenomenon further.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_2": "After a day of research, I saw something sparkling in the tall grass near where the Weedle were gathering.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_3": "It turned out to be a smooth, stonelike object with a symbol etched into it. It glowed with an energy I\u2019ve never encountered before!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_4": "I\u2019d seen that symbol before in documents about Mega Evolution that I received from my colleague in Kalos, Professor Sycamore. That led me to believe that the object was somehow related.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_5": "After digging further into the documents, I theorized that Pok\u00e9mon can Mega Evolve using the energy from the object I found, which I named Mega Energy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_6": "It also occurred to me that the object I found might be related to Weedle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_0_7": "Now that I\u2019ve caught you up on my BIG discovery, let\u2019s get started on some research. We\u2019ll need a Weedle\u2014I think that Pok\u00e9mon has mega potential!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Let\u2019s document our findings for other Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_1": "Now, Weedle can\u2019t Mega Evolve, but its final Evolution, Beedrill, can.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_2": "My theory is that there is Mega Energy for different Pok\u00e9mon and that each Pok\u00e9mon needs a certain amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_3": "It also seems that Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon return to normal once their Mega Energy is depleted.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_4": "It may be difficult to gather the Mega Energy needed to Mega Evolve a Pok\u00e9mon for the first time. However, it seems that once a Pok\u00e9mon has Mega Evolved, it requires less Mega Energy to do so again.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_5": "Maybe it\u2019s because Mega Evolution strengthens a Trainer\u2019s bond with their Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_1_6": "Let\u2019s continue this investigation. How about you evolve your Weedle to its final Evolution and see whether you can find enough Mega Energy to Mega Evolve your new Beedrill.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_0": "Again, you never cease to amaze me, %PLAYERNAME%. I think you and Beedrill are going to be great partners.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_1": "I\u2019ve learned that some other Pok\u00e9mon can Mega Evolve, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_2": "While I\u2019ve been able to confirm only a few, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll discover more in time. At this point, you should be able to Mega Evolve your Beedrill, if you\u2019re ready.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_3": "Now, I\u2019m sure you are going to ask, \u201cProfessor Willow, how do I get Mega Energy for other Pok\u00e9mon?\u201d",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_4": "Well, don\u2019t worry, Trainer. Mega Venusaur, Mega Charizard, and Mega Blastoise are appearing in Mega Raids all around the world. It appears you can get Mega Energy by challenging those Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_5": "Why don\u2019t you Mega Evolve your Beedrill and battle with it in Mega Raids? There seem to be benefits to battling in raids alongside Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon for both you and your fellow Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_2_6": "I\u2019m curious to see what effect Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon have on other Pok\u00e9mon when they battle together. Why don\u2019t you give it a try!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_0": "I dare say, this was a successful research project! It looks like you were able to acquire some Mega Energy by battling those Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_1": "I\u2019ve documented that you and your Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon can do many other things together, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_2": "I hope to see you and your Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon battling at Gyms, challenging other Trainers, combating Team GO Rocket, and, of course, taking some snapshots to send back to yours truly.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_3": "Mega-Evolved Pok\u00e9mon are extremely powerful, so I think it\u2019s best that we don\u2019t bring our new friends into the GO Battle League just yet, at least until more research is done.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_4": "I wanted to give you a token of my appreciation for all your hard work on this project\u2014a Mega Bracelet!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megabee_3_5": "In other regions, Trainers use Mega Bracelets to help their Pok\u00e9mon Mega Evolve. Based on my research into Mega Energy, it seems you won\u2019t need a Mega Bracelet to Mega Evolve your Pok\u00e9mon.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_3": "While I finish my preparations, how about you take a quick survey of the area and see what Pok\u00e9mon are out and about today?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_0_4": "I\u2019ll be ready by the time you\u2019re back.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_0": "Ah, good\u2014you\u2019re back. I\u2019ve just finished getting everything ready.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_1": "Have you tried to Mega Evolve a Pok\u00e9mon lately?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_2": "Something about Mega Evolution caught my attention recently, so I was hoping you could help me investigate.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1_3": "Let\u2019s take a closer look at Mega Evolution, from beginning to end.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_1": "Venusaur absorbs solar energy as nutrition. By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun\u2019s rays, it fills its body with power.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1a_2": "While I fetch Venusaur, how about you go out and catch a few Pok\u00e9mon as a warm-up. Don\u2019t forget to power them up, too.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_megav3_branch_quest_1b_1": "Its bond with its Trainer is the source of its power. It boasts speed and maneuverability greater than that of a jet fighter.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_0_3": "Do you know about the Alola region, %PLAYERNAME%? It\u2019s a cluster of tropical islands, each with unique scenery and Pok\u00e9mon.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_1": "Thanks for looking into the Alola region\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon! You\u2019re as diligent as ever.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_2": "Let me take a look at what you\u2019ve discovered. Hmm... It seems many of the Pok\u00e9mon you just met can be found on Alola\u2019s Melemele Island.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_3": "Melemele Island is where many of Alola\u2019s Trainers begin their island challenge. It\u2019s very fitting that the Pok\u00e9mon you just met are also some of the first that young Trainers in Alola meet, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_1_4": "Now, let\u2019s have a little more fun! Could you take a few snapshots of your new Pok\u00e9mon friends or feed them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_0": "Back already, %PLAYERNAME%? You and your Pok\u00e9mon already seem to be closer. But who doesn\u2019t love a good Pinap Berry? Speaking of, maybe it\u2019s time for another glass of juice...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_1": "Delicious juice aside, did you know that each island in the Alola region has its own Island Guardian? Melemele Island\u2019s guardian deity is Tapu Koko.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_2": "Why do I bring this up? Well, while you were away, I was looking for a clean glass and caught a startling yellow flash out of the corner of my eye!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_3": "The lightning-wielding Tapu Koko is known to fly faster than the eye can follow. With so many other Pok\u00e9mon found on Melemele Island appearing, could it be that Tapu Koko is visiting as well?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_2_4": "Could you look around and see if you can spot Tapu Koko, %PLAYERNAME%? I\u2019m eager to know if what I saw was truly the Land Spirit Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! What\u2019s that? You were able to see Tapu Koko? That\u2019s incredible!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_1": "And would you believe it: Spark was just here, raving that he\u2019d seen Tapu Koko, too! So it is in the area after all. What an exceptional discovery, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_2": "I wonder why Tapu Koko is here. Tapu Koko is said to be a Pok\u00e9mon brimming with curiosity\u2014but, naturally, island guardians tend to stay on their respective islands. The fact that one of them is here may mean something is amiss...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_3": "Or did someone do something to anger it? I\u2019ll have to do some more research before I can say anything for sure.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_4": "Do you think we\u2019ll get a chance to meet the other island guardians, %PLAYERNAME%? Wouldn\u2019t that be something.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_melemele_3_5": "I guess we\u2019ll just have to wait and see. Until then, let\u2019s kick back and enjoy a little R and R with our new friends!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you run into any Pok\u00e9mon wearing fun costumes recently? I\u2019ve seen quite a few around my mobile lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_1": "It reminded me how freeing it can be to express yourself in different ways. Personally, I\u2019m a big fan of turning up my tunes and shredding on the air guitar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_2": "Others, like Spark, are really into taking snapshots of Pok\u00e9mon and the world around them. I wonder how those Pok\u00e9mon feel when they wear those costumes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_0_3": "Sounds to me like some research is in order!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer! I was digging through some old files while you were out when I began to hear a strange melody coming from somewhere nearby.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_1": "I ran out to investigate, and in my haste, I ended up bumping straight into Blanche, who\u2019d been sorting through some Berries.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_2": "Blanche was none too pleased to see those Berries scattered on the ground, but the costumed Pok\u00e9mon that rushed in to gobble them up sure seemed thankful. Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_3": "Seeing them relish those Berries gave me an idea. Cooking food can be a terrific way to express yourself, and giving food to those we care about is one of the most heartfelt things we do for one another.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_1_4": "I wonder how different Pok\u00e9mon react to different foods. While I go on a Berry run, why don\u2019t you do some research on how Pok\u00e9mon feel after eating?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_0": "Thanks for completing those research tasks, Trainer! Reading the results of your research made my heart full\u2014and my stomach rumbly! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_1": "Ah, by the way! I heard that mysterious melody again while I was collecting Berries. I think it may be the product of a certain Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_2": "I wasn\u2019t able to look into it further at the time\u2014my hands were quite full with Berries\u2014but I\u2019m hoping we can investigate it together soon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_3": "For now, could you continue researching how people and Pok\u00e9mon express themselves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_4": "For many Trainers and their Pok\u00e9mon, battling is a primary outlet of self-expression. In fact, Candela believes that the feelings she shares with her Pok\u00e9mon can directly influence the outcome of a battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_2_5": "Why don\u2019t you go out and see for yourself? I\u2019ll be cheering you on from here!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_0": "Welcome back, Trainer. Did you learn anything about expressing yourself in battle?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_1": "While you were out, I managed to track that mysterious melody to a location nearby. I think the source may be none other than Meloetta, the Melody Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_2": "Did you know that its melodies are sung with a special vocalization method that can control the feelings of those who hear it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_3_3": "Maybe if we find a way to express ourselves through song as well, you\u2019ll be able to catch Meloetta\u2019s attention! What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew you\u2019d find a way to catch Meloetta\u2019s attention.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_1": "They say many famous songs have been inspired by the melodies that Meloetta produces, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Self-expression through song is a truly powerful thing!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_4_2": "I think this would be a fine opportunity for you to partner with Meloetta and share who you are with your friends. I\u2019m sure Meloetta would be happy to learn more about you, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_0": "Da da da dooo... Da dee doo, dee da dee dum...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_1": "Oh, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014I didn\u2019t see you there! I was just rocking out to one of my favorite songs. After so much research on how people express themselves, I felt compelled to indulge in a bit of self-expression myself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_2": "Whether it\u2019s serving looks or serving lunch, a Pok\u00e9mon battle or battle of the bands, there\u2019s no limit to the ways you can express who you are. What\u2019s your method of choice, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meloetta_5_3": "Maybe you\u2019re still figuring it out\u2014and that\u2019s totally fine. Everyone\u2019s journey is unique! Whatever the case, you have my support\u2014and Meloetta\u2019s, too. Now, let\u2019s get out there and show the world who we are!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, it\u2019s always great to see you! I\u2019m sure you know this, but your help in progressing my research has been essential to major breakthroughs in my work.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_1": "That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to talk to you again. You probably already know what I\u2019ll be asking!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_2": "I need your assistance in learning more about the newly discovered Pok\u00e9mon that has really sent me and other Pok\u00e9mon researchers into quite a tizzy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_3": "Can you believe an undiscovered Pok\u00e9mon just appeared out of the blue? You can imagine how everyone is talking about it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_4": "I was checking a nearby habitat when I ran into a nest of them, and I was so excited, I dropped my camera! Don\u2019t worry, though... I\u2019m sure the repairs won\u2019t cost me too much at the shop...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_5": "Although each Pok\u00e9mon turned out to be a Ditto using the move Transform, that didn\u2019t put a damper on my day!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_6": "So many Ditto taking on this unique Pok\u00e9mon form must mean that the real Pok\u00e9mon is truly out there, just waiting to be found.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_7": "Let\u2019s get to work, %PLAYERNAME%! I know we don\u2019t have much to go on, but I\u2019m confident your hard work can only bring us good fortune!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_0_8": "But first, let me recalibrate my instruments for your area. Could you please complete the following tasks?\n{0}\n{1}\n{2}",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_0": "Thanks, %PLAYERNAME%! I think that will be enough to help me properly conduct calculations based on the data you\u2019ll gather in the field.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_1": "While you were out, I scanned some academic journals to see if any of my fellow researchers have encountered a Pok\u00e9mon matching the description of the species I saw, but I didn\u2019t have much luck.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_2": "But I do have a hunch! Given that this Pok\u00e9mon has been unseen until just recently, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re tracking another Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, like Mew and Celebi.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_3": "If I\u2019m right and this elusive Pok\u00e9mon is a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, we should be able to draw it out by creating specific conditions under which it thrives.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_4": "But let\u2019s step back for a minute, before we take a step forward. Or many steps forward, in this case! Great fieldwork starts with a walk. Could you complete a few tasks for me?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_1_5": "Also, remind me to contact my mentor, Professor Oak. I\u2019m certain his brilliant mind will have something to lend to all this...",

  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, I gave Professor Oak a call, and he pulled through! He says that the Pok\u00e9mon is called Meltan! I think the name has a nice ring to it\u2014don\u2019t you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_1": "Professor Oak got this information through an ancient text found in his archives, which included the appearance of Meltan.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_3": "He and I are of the same opinion that Meltan is a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, so I really think we\u2019re on to something!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_2_4": "Still, a name alone isn\u2019t going to get us very far... Perhaps the Ditto know something we don\u2019t?",

  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! The Ditto you\u2019ve helped me analyze indeed has transformed into Meltan before. In fact, it was able to use Transform and let me analyze Meltan up close!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_1": "This Ditto was very helpful, even though it couldn\u2019t replicate some of the finer details. It seems the memory of Meltan is fading away...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_3_2": "But I have good news! I was able to tell that Meltan has a liquid-metal body with a nutlike head and a tail that looks like a power cord. Judging from the appearance, it may be an Electric- or Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_2": "Then I realized that it was copying every aspect of Meltan, including its behavioral patterns. Given the Ditto\u2019s behavior, I believe Meltan is capable of assimilating metal by melting metal objects. What an interesting ability!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_3": "I can now say that, according to my research, Meltan is a Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_4_4": "I think our next step is to study more Pok\u00e9mon that have similar characteristics. Can you complete the following tasks to learn more about Pok\u00e9mon with fluid body surfaces or stomach acid strong enough to melt metals?",

  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_1": "Meltan very well may have split from a Pok\u00e9mon named Melmetal, which has been recorded even less than Meltan. Never before have we seen a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon that can divide into multiple, independent Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_2": "This explains why the world saw a simultaneous appearance of so many Ditto disguised as Meltan.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_5_3": "Professor Oak and I have made a guess as to how Meltan can re-form back into Melmetal\u2014because Meltan have bodies similar to molten metal, they have a unique ability to merge and trigger an Evolution into Melmetal!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_1": "Of course, the reason for Meltan\u2019s presence inside this mysterious box can only be guessed. Maybe the people who glorified and worshiped Melmetal decided to keep it safe when the Pok\u00e9mon somehow split itself apart.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_meltan_8_2": "Doing so could have been thought of as the only way for the people to ever meet Melmetal again. That warms the heart a little, doesn\u2019t it, %PLAYERNAME%?",

  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve caught me at a curious time. You see, I was just out for a walk, thinking about how much I\u2019d love to see a Mudkip, when\u2014wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2014I came across a whole mess of them!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_1": "Did you know that Mudkip sleep by burying themselves in soil at the water\u2019s edge? Sounds adorable, right?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_2": "One of the many things that\u2019s always impressed me about Mudkip is how strong it is in spite of its size.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_3": "When faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will unleash its amazing power. It can even crush rocks much bigger than itself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_4": "It would be less than ideal if all these Mudkip were to do that right now... And yet, the researcher in me is curious to see it happen! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_0_5": "Anyway, what do you say we do a bit of research on Mudkip, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see you\u2019ve brought a Mudkip with you\u2014nice work!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_1": "Using the fin on its head, Mudkip senses the flow of water to keep track of what\u2019s going on around it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_2": "I got a bit too close during my observations earlier, and those Mudkip splashed mud all over my coat! Which actually got me thinking about Mudkip\u2019s Evolution, Marshtomp.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_3": "Living on muddy ground that provides poor footing has made Marshtomp\u2019s legs sturdy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_4": "And because it\u2019s used to such slippery surfaces, Marshtomp can quickly overwhelm foes mired in mud.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_1_5": "While I clean my coat off, why don\u2019t you try evolving your Mudkip so you can see Marshtomp firsthand, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_0": "I knew I should\u2019ve brought an extra coat with me... Ah! Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. That\u2019s a very sturdy-looking Marshtomp you have with you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_1": "Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s inspiring how Pok\u00e9mon thrive in all sorts of environments? Mudkip and Marshtomp seem like an especially versatile bunch.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_2": "Now, I have some exciting news. I caught a glimpse of some Swampert\u2014Marshtomp\u2019s Evolution\u2014while you were away!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_3": "Swampert can not only break boulders into pieces with one swing of its arms, but it can also predict storms by sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_4": "I tend to get so engrossed in my research that I lose track of my surroundings, so having a Swampert around might be just what I need.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_5": "...What\u2019s that? I could just try to pay a bit more attention myself? Well, I suppose that\u2019s an option... But not quite as fun, don\u2019t you think? Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_2_6": "Why don\u2019t you try evolving your Marshtomp, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_0": "Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s hard to believe that Swampert of yours was once a tiny, adorable Mudkip. Pok\u00e9mon really are incredible!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_1": "Swampert tend to make nests near beautiful beaches, and it\u2019s strong enough to tow a large ship.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_2": "I guess you know which Pok\u00e9mon to bring with you on your next beach vacation, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_3": "You know, the last time I saw Mudkip appearing en masse like they are today, I also saw all manner of Trainers out exploring and researching, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_4": "It always fills me with joy to see everyone having fun with Pok\u00e9mon. I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed yourself today as well!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_mudkt_3_5": "As for me, I think it\u2019s time I stomp on home. I\u2019ll be in touch!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_0": "Hmm... It\u2019s not like they sprouted legs and walked off, so what could have\u2014",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_1": "Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! Sorry, I didn\u2019t notice you there. I\u2019m trying to figure out where my Pinap Berries went. Maybe you could help me figure it out!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_2": "You see, Pinap Berries have been particularly abundant around here as of late. I\u2019ve never seen so many growing at once!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_3": "It\u2019s like the soil\u2019s been filled with nature\u2019s energy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_4": "Pinap fan that I am, I picked a basketful to juice and set it down right over there, but I got distracted reading this paper on regional differences in Slowpoke.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_5": "And when I turned around, the whole basket was empty!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_6": "I suppose now I have a wonderful excuse to go for a stroll and gather more...but all the same, I\u2019m curious why they vanished in the first place.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_0_7": "While I pick more Berries, %PLAYERNAME%, can you poke around and see if any Pok\u00e9mon in the area might be responsible?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Welcome ba\u2014whoa there!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_1": "Excuse my sudden wobbling. I take it you\u2019ve found yourself some Noibat! Their enormous ears can emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_2": "For the record, even a robust wrestler will become dizzy and unable to stand when exposed to Noibat\u2019s ultrasonic waves!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_3": "At any rate, I think you\u2019ve found our culprit, since fruits are its favorite foods. That must be why they swiped my Pinap Berries! Well, I\u2019m always more than happy to share with Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_4": "But there\u2019s a silver lining to finding our Berry bandit\u2014now we\u2019ve got the perfect Pok\u00e9mon to research today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_1_5": "See if you can attract more Noibat with Pinap Berries, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%! Those Noibat sure look happy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_1": "I suppose Noibat and I share an appreciation for Pinap Berries, huh? And it\u2019s no phase, I assure you\u2014Noibat\u2019s love of fruit persists even after evolving into Noivern.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_2": "Although Noivern have a violent disposition, if you give them a nice ripe fruit that they love, they will suddenly become tame.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_3": "Y\u2019know, there\u2019s an idea\u2014why not help your Noibat evolve into Noivern, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_2_4": "I reckon the Pinap Berries you fed them will keep that temper of theirs at bay!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%! I must say, your Noivern looks pretty chipper.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_1": "My research says that this Pok\u00e9mon is often aggressive and will ruthlessly torment enemies that are helpless in the dark. Yikes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_2": "Luckily for us, your Noivern looks quite fond of you! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll continue to be great friends, even if you don\u2019t have its beloved fruits on hand.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_3": "Thanks for spending the day learning with me. It\u2019s always fun when we find something we have in common with Pok\u00e9mon, don\u2019t you think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_4": "Of course, I\u2019m talking about a love of Berries\u2014not sharing a cruel disposition!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_noibat_3_5": "I hope you\u2019d agree with that, right, %PLAYERNAME%?\n...Right?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_0": "Hi there! It\u2019s so nice to meet you, %PLAYERNAME%. My name is Professor Willow. I\u2019m a Pok\u00e9mon researcher, and I\u2019ll be guiding you on your journey\u2014and what a journey it shall be!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_1": "You\u2019ll also be helping me with my research along the way. So really, we\u2019re more like colleagues!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_2": "First things first\u2014let\u2019s go over how to catch Pok\u00e9mon, make a Curveball Throw, and transfer Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_3": "You can catch Pok\u00e9mon with Pok\u00e9 Balls.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_4": "If you throw a Pok\u00e9 Ball at the center of the Pok\u00e9mon and time your throw just right, you can even achieve a Nice, Great, or Excellent Throw!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_5": "Curveball Throws are advanced throws that can help you grow even more as a Trainer. To make a Curveball Throw, spin the Pok\u00e9 Ball as you throw it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_6": "It\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t get it at first. That\u2019s what practice is for!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_7": "Once you\u2019ve caught some Pok\u00e9mon, you can keep them in your Pok\u00e9mon storage or transfer them to my mobile lab in exchange for Candy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_0_8": "I\u2019ll explain more about Candy later. For now, how about you go catch some Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_0": "Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! How was catching Pok\u00e9mon? Not too bad after the first few tries, right?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_1": "Soon, you\u2019ll be making Excellent Curveball Throws as easily as a Goldeen swims in water!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_2": "Next, I\u2019d like to talk to you about an item that I\u2019ve created called Incense.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_3": "It emits a fragrance that is irresistible to Pok\u00e9mon, making them come to you, instead of having you go to them! Handy, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_4": "If you know you\u2019re going to be out adventuring for a while, using Incense can really boost the amount of Pok\u00e9mon you encounter. It\u2019s one of my favorite items.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_5": "Speaking of items, have you heard of Berries? There are several different types that Pok\u00e9mon enjoy eating, and they each have different effects.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_6": "For example, Nanab Berries calm Pok\u00e9mon down, making it easier for you to aim a Pok\u00e9 Ball at them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_1_7": "How about you give these items a try? Go ahead and use an Incense to attract Pok\u00e9mon. Then, use Nanab Berries to help you catch them!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_0": "Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%! Great work using Incense and Berries to help you catch Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_1": "If you\u2019re ever running low on Berries or Pok\u00e9 Balls, you can visit Pok\u00e9Stops to get more.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_2": "Spinning the Photo Disc at a Pok\u00e9Stop can grant you those items as well as other goodies. You can also get Field Research tasks by doing so, which you can complete to encounter Pok\u00e9mon or receive items.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_3": "Pok\u00e9Stops are usually located at interesting places, like a monument, a public park, or a local caf\u00e9.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_4": "They encourage Trainers to explore the world around them. Isn\u2019t that exciting?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_2_5": "Why don\u2019t you go do some exploring? Who knows\u2014you might discover some interesting places!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_0": "Welcome back, Trainer! I just returned from a stroll myself. One thing I love about Field Research is how it always manages to take me to new and exciting locations.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_1": "I hope you get to learn a bit more about the world around you as you seek out different Pok\u00e9Stops!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_2": "And as fun as that will be, it\u2019ll be even more fun if you bring along a Buddy Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_onboard_sr_3_3": "Building strong relationships with your Pok\u00e9mon is pivotal to being a good Trainer\u2014and choosing a Pok\u00e9mon to be your buddy is a great way to do just that!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_oshat_3_0": "Excellent work, Trainer! That\u2019s a fine Samurott. Its seamitars truly are a sight to behold! Knowing how quickly it can draw and sheathe its blades, I wonder how fast it can dice up berries...",

  "quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_1_1": "Some researchers recommend that Trainers bring their Poliwag on walks every day to strengthen its legs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_1_2": "Of course, such regimented training isn\u2019t necessary for Poliwhirl, Poliwag\u2019s Evolution. Its two legs are well developed, and it can be seen marching all over in search of bug Pok\u00e9mon to eat.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_1_3": "Why don\u2019t you try evolving a Poliwag, %PLAYERNAME%? But be careful you don\u2019t look at Poliwhirl\u2019s swirl for too long. I\u2019ll tell you about THAT when you get back!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_5": "...Ack! Sorry, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014looking at your Poliwhirl almost put me to sleep! Now, where was I? Ah, yes! Another special trait of Poliwhirl\u2019s is that it can evolve into two different Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_6": "First, we have the brawny Poliwrath. Its body is solid muscle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_7": "When swimming through cold seas, Poliwrath uses its impressive arms to smash through drifting ice and plow forward.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poliwag_2_8": "And second, we have the commanding Politoed! It\u2019s the leader of Poliwag and Poliwhirl. When Politoed roars, they all cower in fear.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_2": "That\u2019s right\u2014I\u2019ve had enough of waiting to see a guardian deity. Everyone but me has managed to glimpse one out of pure serendipity, so I\u2019ve decided to be proactive and embark on a search for Tapu Fini!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_0_3": "Do you think you could lend me a hand? With you involved, I think my chance of success will skyrocket.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_2": "With that in mind, I\u2019d hazard a guess that we\u2019ll have the most luck uncovering Tapu Fini\u2019s whereabouts if we look in places where other Water-type Pok\u00e9mon are appearing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_3": "I\u2019ll start by visiting every foggy lake I can find. I can hear Blanche\u2019s water safety spiel already...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_4": "But, personally speaking, a bit of risk is worth it if I finally get to see an island guardian with my own eyes! You remember to be careful, too, okay?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_1_5": "Now, let\u2019s get back out there!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_2_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe it?!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_4": "Just have to stay positive. No use feeling jealous of others\u2019 good fortune...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_5": "Now that we know all the island guardians are nearby, we should look into why they\u2019ve appeared here.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_6": "Were the cause some unsavory act on our part, I think they would have confronted us directly by now\u2014but instead, we\u2019ve been the ones tracking them down.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_7": "It\u2019s certainly possible their motives have nothing to do with us. Though I have to assume they\u2019re investigating the area for a reason.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poni_3_8": "But what could that reason be? I suppose all we can do for now is wait and see what happens.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_popplio_0_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Can you believe our luck? It\u2019s a wonder to see so many Popplio gathered in one place.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_popplio_0_1": "I\u2019ve heard these hardworking Pok\u00e9mon can inflate balloons with their noses. How fascinating!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_popplio_1_3": "Popplio\u2019s charm doesn\u2019t end there, either. Try evolving your Popplio into Brionne, and you\u2019ll see what I mean!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_popplio_2_0": "You did it, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Brionne has a magnetic stage presence. Just look at it go\u2014it\u2019s quite the performer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_popplio_2_1": "Have you been teaching it some new moves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_popplio_2_2": "Brionne is bound to be an entertaining new companion. I\u2019ve heard that when their Trainers are feeling down, Brionne perform a cheery dance to help perk them up.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_1": "Speaking of research, have you heard of Porygon, the Virtual Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_2": "Well, I\u2019m not entirely sure why, but Porygon have been appearing more frequently in the area as of late!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_0_3": "I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to learn more about this odd Pok\u00e9mon. How about it, Trainer? Will you go out and catch some Porygon for me?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_0": "Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_1": "I was able to review the data you collected, and I discovered that Porygon is made entirely of programming code!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_2": "Other reports I dug up mention that it was created by a group of scientists using state-of-the-art technology. Can you believe it? A man-made Pok\u00e9mon!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_4": "Maybe I should keep a Porygon around in case Team GO Rocket tries a digital take-over...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_5": "Well, in the meantime, I\u2019d like to learn more about Porygon\u2019s evolved form, Porygon2.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_1_6": "I have a hunch that you\u2019ll need to use an Upgrade to evolve Porygon. Let's get back out there and see if we can't find one!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_1": "Thanks to your efforts, I\u2019ve realized just how different Porygon2 is from Porygon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_2": "According to my findings, further research and the implementation of artificial intelligence into its code allowed Porygon2 to develop the ability to learn independent of its programming.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_3": "The power of science is just astounding, isn\u2019t it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_2_4": "These reports also mention that Porygon2 was upgraded to enable extraterrestrial exploration and planetary development, though it has yet to accomplish much.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_2": "According to reports, an update was added to Porygon-Z\u2019s programming that was supposed to allow it to move between dimensions. But the upgrade also caused Porygon-Z to become unstable, and it began behaving erratically.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_3": "Because the update caused instability, academics can\u2019t seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_poryt_3_4": "It\u2019s going to take a bit of time to file away all this research, but I\u2019m thrilled we were able to learn more about Porygon and its Evolutions!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_1": "Have you seen those Pok\u00e9 Ball\u2013like Pok\u00e9mon rolling about?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_10": "This all begs the question: why are Hisuian Voltorb appearing now after being absent for so long? Did they somehow travel to the present from the Sinnoh region of the past?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_11": "I have a theory that when Team GO Rocket broke open the mysterious door, it somehow caused these Hisuian Voltorb to appear in our time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_12": "Now why am I suddenly reminded of Celebi, the Time Travel Pok\u00e9mon...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_13": "Anyway, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got! Kind of unbelievable, isn\u2019t it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_14": "I\u2019m going to do some more digging on my end, and I\u2019d love your help researching these bygone Pok\u00e9mon out in the field!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_15": "Let\u2019s investigate Hisuian Voltorb together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_2": "They look an awful lot like Voltorb\u2014a Pok\u00e9mon native to the Kanto region, among others\u2014but I\u2019ve never seen any Voltorb quite like these.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_3": "I reached out to everyone I could think of and pored over all the research documents I could get my hands on, but get this: nothing in modern scholarship mentions this Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_4": "However, I did eventually find something. Did you know that the Sinnoh region used to be known as the Hisui region?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_5": "Well, I found historical documentation of an old-fashioned Pok\u00e9 Ball developed long ago in the Hisui region, and I realized it greatly resembles this mysterious Pok\u00e9mon. Or could it be the other way around?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_6": "Which came first: the Pok\u00e9 Ball or the Pok\u00e9mon? Who knows!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_7": "Taking all this into consideration, I believe this anomalous Pok\u00e9mon is, in fact, a Voltorb that once lived in the Hisui region.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_8": "Is it still a regional variant if it only existed in the past? Gosh, what a puzzle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_0_9": "For now, I suppose we may as well call this Pok\u00e9mon Hisuian Voltorb.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_0": "I\u2019m still reeling, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_1": "Can you believe Pok\u00e9mon from a different time are now appearing around us?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_10": "Anyway. Our research sure has been exciting lately, hasn\u2019t it, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_11": "Something tells me we\u2019re in for even more exciting discoveries!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_12": "Let\u2019s keep at it and see what else our adventure together brings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_2": "I wonder what this Pok\u00e9mon has seen in the Hisui region\u2014and what it thinks of the future it\u2019s suddenly seeing now!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_3": "Ah, the Hisui region... I wonder what other kinds of Pok\u00e9mon lived there.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_4": "What I wouldn\u2019t give to go back in time and experience the Hisui region for myself! It\u2019d be a dream come true!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_5": "Maybe if I ever meet Celebi, I could ask it for a quick trip back in time, just to sate my curiosity!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_6": "...But I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s nice to dream, though!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_7": "Anyway, I\u2019ve decided to research whether Hisuian Voltorb can evolve.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_8": "I haven\u2019t the foggiest if it can, but that won\u2019t stop me. I want to learn everything about this strange and wonderful Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_power_jan22_1_9": "After all, it\u2019s not every day that a literal blast from the past falls into your lap! Get it? Because Voltorb can Self-Destruct? Haha...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_0": "Hi, %PLAYERNAME%, I\u2019m glad to see you! Can I get your help with investigating something?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_1": "I\u2019ve noticed an alarming number of reports from Trainers who have found Pok\u00e9Stops that look...discolored?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_2": "Some Trainers have even spotted people wearing shirts with a big letter R on them who are guarding these Pok\u00e9Stops.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_3": "These shady characters appear to have Pok\u00e9mon with a mysterious dark aura around them!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_0_4": "As I investigate this with Spark, it might be best to power up some of your Pok\u00e9mon. You never know what we might encounter...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_0": "Great job strengthening your Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_1": "After visiting one of the Pok\u00e9Stops with Spark, we were challenged to a Trainer Battle by someone who belongs to an organization called Team GO Rocket!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_2": "Turns out that Team GO Rocket has been stealing resources from Pok\u00e9Stops with the help of Pok\u00e9mon that are cloaked in a dark aura. They\u2019re called Shadow Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_3": "Luckily, we won the battle, and afterward, Team GO Rocket carelessly abandoned their defeated Shadow Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_1_4": "Help us protect local Pok\u00e9Stops from Team GO Rocket, Trainer! As you do so, please save any Shadow Pok\u00e9mon that Team GO Rocket abandons!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_0": "Thanks for all your hard work, %PLAYERNAME%! Candela and I have done some research on Shadow Pok\u00e9mon and learned some very unsettling things.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_1": "While Pok\u00e9mon naturally become stronger through training, these Shadow Pok\u00e9mon seem to have been overpowered through unnatural means.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_2": "As a result, their bodies painfully struggle with not knowing how to control this strength.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_3": "But don\u2019t worry! It looks like we can help them harness this strength through a process called purification.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_2_4": "Can you help me purify some Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_0": "WOW! Thanks for helping us learn more about the Shadow Pok\u00e9mon that Team GO Rocket uses, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_1": "After observing the purification process with Blanche, it\u2019s clear that the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s gratefulness to you for purifying them causes the move Frustration to be replaced with Return!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_2": "Now that you have this knowledge, we need your help with saving as many Shadow Pok\u00e9mon as possible by taking back Pok\u00e9Stops that are under Team GO Rocket\u2019s control!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rocket_3_3": "The world is under attack! Can we count on you to help protect it? I do hope there\u2019s nothing more to this...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! How have you been? Finding time to relax, I hope? Perhaps with your Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_1": "I\u2019m enjoying a bit of a productivity boom, myself, but it\u2019s made me realize that my research has gone uninterrupted for quite some time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_2": "I fear there may be trouble brewing\u2014specifically from Team GO Rocket. They\u2019ve been too quiet for too long, don\u2019t you think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_0_3": "Would you mind patrolling the area to see if anything\u2019s amiss?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. As much as I wish they\u2019d give us a break, I know Team GO Rocket never rests\u2014so neither can we!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_1": "I\u2019m relieved to see you\u2019ve rescued a couple of Shadow Pok\u00e9mon from them already.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_2": "As both a professor and as someone who loves Pok\u00e9mon, I can\u2019t stand idly by as Team GO Rocket mistreats so many innocent Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_1_3": "Let\u2019s get back out there and rescue some more Pok\u00e9mon from them!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for handling those Team GO Rocket Grunts. You and your Pok\u00e9mon have done a great job of scaring them off, as usual!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_1": "They\u2019ll think twice before showing up around here again, I suspect.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_2": "But those Shadow Pok\u00e9mon they\u2019ve left behind... Well, at least they\u2019re safe with us now.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_2_3": "%PLAYERNAME%, let\u2019s purify them so they can put their terrible time with Team GO Rocket in the past. I know they\u2019ll be grateful for your help!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_0": "Those Pok\u00e9mon are looking much better now, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re relieved to be with a Trainer like you and away from Team GO Rocket.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_1": "Now that we\u2019ve cleared out some of their underlings, I think we\u2019d better track down the Team GO Rocket Leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_3_2": "Based on how you handled those Grunts, I\u2019m sure the Leaders won\u2019t stand a chance!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_0": "You\u2019ve done it, %PLAYERNAME%! Once again, you\u2019ve been instrumental in stopping Team GO Rocket from getting their way.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_1": "It\u2019s a privilege to watch you and your partners grow together and use your strength to help Pok\u00e9mon everywhere.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_2": "Now. We\u2019ve neutralized the Team GO Rocket Leaders, so it\u2019s time to let Giovanni know that we\u2019re not going to let him carry out his plan unchallenged.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_4_3": "I know he\u2019s tough\u2014but you\u2019re tougher. I have the utmost confidence in you, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_0": "Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You and your Pok\u00e9mon have an impressive bond\u2014one that Team GO Rocket will never be able match.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_1": "Pok\u00e9mon everywhere are fortunate to have you on their side!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_2": "I know it won\u2019t be long before Team GO Rocket appears with another scheme, but I can rest a bit easier knowing that you\u2019re here to stop them right in their tracks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq10_5_3": "For now, though, get some rest. You\u2019ve more than earned it!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_0": "Greetings, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_1": "There appears to be an increased number of Team GO Rocket members in the area.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_2": "I have yet to determine what they are doing here, but I suspect that a scheme of some sort is underway.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_0_3": "We should investigate before they decide to cause trouble.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_0": "Thank you, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. The atmosphere is improved with fewer Team GO Rocket members present.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_1": "One detail still mystifies me. Why do the Pok\u00e9mon used by Team GO Rocket possess those peculiar auras?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_2": "I see. They become Shadow Pok\u00e9mon through experimentation and mistreatment.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_3": "So they corrupt a blameless creature, and then they abandon it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_4": "Their cruelty is unforgiveable.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_5": "I am coming to realize that this group will pursue their goals relentlessly and without conscience.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_6": "We must impede them however we can.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_1_7": "Come, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\u2014let us begin by rescuing some Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_0": "Those poor Pok\u00e9mon...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_1": "... ... ...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_2": "Ah\u2014Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_3": "Apologies for my dour demeanor. I cannot stop thinking about the Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_4": "Is there nothing we can do beyond rescuing them from Team GO Rocket? Will they remain in this state forever?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_5": "Hm? You are able to...purify them?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_6": "If doing so removes their ominous aura, I would like nothing more than to observe this phenomenon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_2_7": "Will you show me, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_0": "So this is a Purified Pok\u00e9mon. Its shadowy aura is gone. In its place\u2014radiance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_1": "You are deserving of praise, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. But our efforts cannot end here. ",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_2": "Perhaps we should turn our attention to Team GO Rocket members of a higher standing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_3_3": "If you can defeat their leaders in battle, we may hinder their plans.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_0": "Those battles were among the fiercest I have witnessed, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. I am fortunate to call you my ally.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_1": "Regrettably, it seems the Team GO Rocket leaders were not inspired to change their ways. They, too, have abandoned their Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_2": "But surely we have at least stalled their plans. Such an expansive organization cannot function without its leaders at full strength.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_3": "Hm? We must still deal with this...Giovanni, is it? I see.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_4_4": "Then our work is not yet finished, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_0": "That was a fearsome battle, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_1": "I am dazzled by your capacity to overcome any challenge set before you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_2": "Please, relish your well-earned victory\u2014but we must remain vigilant. If Team GO Rocket were to manipulate the Ultra Beasts...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_3": "We do not want their villainy to interfere with our endeavors.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_4": "For now, however, I think we can turn our attention back to the Ultra Wormholes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_5": "So long as they remain open in your world, more Ultra Beasts could appear.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_6": "Though considering the strength you displayed today, perhaps my fear is unnecessary.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_7": "In any case, thank you for allowing me to observe you today. I am pleased we were able to assist so many Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq11_5_8": "Until again, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%. I suspect you have already noticed, but Team GO Rocket seems to be assembling en masse again.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_1": "What shadowy schemes could those ruffians be plotting? They look to be glowering right at you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_2": "Surely they couldn\u2019t be thinking of absconding with the Ultra Beasts?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_3": "Or perhaps they\u2019ve designs on Cosmoem. In its current state, I fear\u2014",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_4": "No. Anxious speculation will not avail us. Preventative measures must come first.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_0_5": "%PLAYERNAME%. Could you use your battling skills to send some of these Grunts away?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_0": "Huh. I thought there were more Team GO Rocket Grunts around earlier...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_1": "Oh, %PLAYERNAME%, it\u2019s you! I guess I\u2019ve got you to thank for getting those goons out of here.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_2": "Rhi says they may be taking an interest in our otherworldly visitors, huh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_3": "I\u2019m inclined to think they\u2019re right. Good thing you\u2019re here to save the day!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_4": "Keep flushing Team GO Rocket out, %PLAYERNAME%. Try looking for their Leaders next.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_1_5": "I\u2019m sure you and Rhi can track them down!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_0": "Brilliant work, %PLAYERNAME%. You\u2019ve managed to defeat Team GO Rocket\u2019s Leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_1": "I knew your superlative skills would lead you to victory. And you had the chance to speak with Professor Willow, correct? What did he have to say?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_2": "I see... Though I am pleased Professor Willow has corroborated my theory, I continue to be concerned for the Ultra Beasts and Cosmoem.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_3": "I take solace in knowing that we have dispersed the majority of Team GO Rocket, if nothing else.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_2_4": "Now, the time has come to challenge the man who sits atop the organization: Giovanni.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_0": "So, you sent Giovanni home with his tail between his legs? Just another day in the life for you, huh, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_1": "It\u2019s no easy feat to put Team GO Rocket back in their place, but you rose to the challenge.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_2": "Great job! Now take some well-deserved rest with your Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq12_3_3": "I\u2019ll be in touch again soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_0_1": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%. You know, it was shaping up to be a beautiful day, but then I noticed there are more Team GO Rocket Grunts than usual lurking about.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_0_2": "Do you think they\u2019re up to something? Could it be connected to all the Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon that\u2019ve been around recently?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_0_3": "I have heard that Team GO Rocket has a reputation for causing trouble at power plants... Hm.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_0_4": "Would you do me a favor and investigate what\u2019s going on, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to be safe.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_1": "Great work dealing with those Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%. They\u2019ll think twice before trying to battle you again!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_2": "If only they\u2019d spare as much thought for the Shadow Pok\u00e9mon they\u2019ve abandoned in their wake.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_3": "I hope that one day, we\u2019ll put a stop Team GO Rocket\u2019s mistreatment of Pok\u00e9mon once and for all.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_4": "But until then, at least we can do something for the Pok\u00e9mon they leave behind.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_1_5": "Let\u2019s purify some Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_2_1": "Welcome back! Those Pok\u00e9mon you purified are looking better already, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_2_2": "Thanks for helping them\u2014and me. It\u2019s a relief to see them safe with you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_2_3": "They\u2019ll shine even brighter the longer they spend with you, I\u2019m sure.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_2_4": "But back to business. Next, look for Cliff, Sierra, and Arlo. We can\u2019t let...whatever they\u2019re doing proceed unchecked! Or untested for nefariousness, at least.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_1": "Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve made quick work of the Team GO Rocket Leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_2": "*sigh* I wish they\u2019d change their ways. I have to give them credit\u2014they\u2019ve got a wealth of knowledge on Pok\u00e9mon, and they\u2019re strong Trainers to boot.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_3": "Imagine what we could learn together if they used that passion for good...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_4": "I know, I know. That\u2019s \u201chighly improbable,\u201d as Rhi might say. No harm in wishing, though!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_3_5": "Now, I have one final request. I\u2019d like you to track down the one person I\u2019m sure will never change: Giovanni, the head of Team GO Rocket!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_1": "Expertly handled, %PLAYERNAME%! I knew Giovanni didn\u2019t stand a chance against you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_2": "You\u2019re getting to be a real pro at battling him. No matter what he throws at you, there\u2019s just no beating the bond between you and your Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_3": "I think it\u2019s time you took a rest and celebrated your victory with the Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve freed from Team GO Rocket\u2019s clutches.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_4": "Let\u2019s hope they learn their lesson one day soon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq13_4_5": "See you later, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_0": "Thanks for your help in defeating Team GO Rocket Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_1": "The team leaders and I have been observing Team GO Rocket, and something tells us this is far from over.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_2": "The transmission sent during the Team GO Rocket take-over had a message from an unknown sender at the end.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_3": "We\u2019re going to need all the help we can get to reveal the identity of this unknown figure looming in the shadows, and you are just the Trainer for the job!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_0_4": "Can you help us get to the bottom of this mystery?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_0": "Thank you for your continued support against those pesky Team GO Rocket Grunts.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_1": "As they flee, some Grunts are leaving behind Mysterious Components.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_2": "I believe these are what Team GO Rocket is using to hack and steal resources from Pok\u00e9Stops. Clever little devices, aren\u2019t they?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_3": "There\u2019s information we can glean from these components that will help us in our fight against this dangerous organization.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_1_4": "Once you have enough pieces, you should be able to assemble something similar to the device I\u2019ve modified in my lab. It might be best to prepare yourself for whatever might come, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_0": "Interesting. It appears there\u2019s more to Team GO Rocket than previously thought.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_2_1": "Their ingenuity has got me thinking there might be another use for these Mysterious Components. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate Team GO Rocket.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_0": "Fantastic work, Trainer. I\u2019ve been working on a prototype for something I call the Rocket Radar, but I was missing some critical components.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq1_3_2": "If we combine my research and these Mysterious Components you\u2019ve found, we can create a radar-like tool to track down Team GO Rocket Hideouts!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_3": "We need to continue saving and purifying these Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_1_4": "Remember this: a good Trainer is strong, but a great Trainer is caring and kind.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_2_0": "Fantastic! Good work purifying all those Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%. They\u2019re practically glowing with gratitude!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_0": "Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! You should enjoy your victory, of course, but it looks like our work isn\u2019t done.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_1": "While you were busy, I was doing some reconnaissance. I have to admit, it\u2019s been quite thrilling!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_2": "As you might have guessed, there are many more hideouts and headquarters out there that the Team GO Rocket Leaders and Giovanni could be hiding in.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq2_5_3": "We may have defeated them for the moment, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be back and causing more trouble soon.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_1": "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen that Team GO Rocket has continued their plans to take over Pok\u00e9Stops and turn even more Pok\u00e9mon into Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_2": "Have you seen an increase in Team GO Rocket activity in your area?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_3": "The team leaders and I have been getting reports from Trainers all over the world that these villains haven\u2019t given up.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_0_4": "We need to keep working to save Pok\u00e9mon from these no-good Grunts and their leaders.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_1_4": "They have you to thank for saving them! Perhaps one of the Pok\u00e9mon you saved will become an essential member of your battle team.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_0": "How has your training been going, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_1": "Be sure to build a healthy habit of improving yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_2": "Training isn\u2019t a one-and-done thing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_2_3": "Becoming a great Trainer is something that comes with continued practice.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_0": "All right! You make the team leaders\u2014and me\u2014proud, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_1": "It\u2019s time to head out and show those Team GO Rocket Leaders that we\u2019re strong enough to hold our own.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_3_2": "We can\u2019t let these bullies get in our way when we\u2019re saving Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_0": "Fantastic work. Have you noticed, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_1": "There seems to be a trend behind which Pok\u00e9mon Giovanni is turning into Shadow Pok\u00e9mon. I\u2019m thinking about the fact that he has Legendary Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_2": "Could that have anything to do with why he\u2019s here?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_3": "In any case, the time has come to track him down.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_4_4": "The more we battle Giovanni and his team of Grunts, the more we learn about why he\u2019s waging these take-overs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_0": "You\u2019ve shown what it takes to be a true Trainer, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_1": "Your battle with Giovanni wasn\u2019t easy, but the skills you\u2019ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_2": "Keep your eyes open, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_3": "Giovanni does not like to lose, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back soon, trying to further his plans.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq3_5_4": "I\u2019m sure I can count on you when he returns.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Thanks for your help battling Team GO Rocket. Trainers like you help keep Pok\u00e9mon safe!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_1": "But this battle is far from over, and we must continue learning about Team GO Rocket, their leaders, and their boss, Giovanni.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_2": "Looks like the Rocket Radar I developed is helping the cause. I remember when this strange activity started happening...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_3": "Back then, I had a hunch the Mysterious Components that Team GO Rocket Grunts were leaving behind held more secrets than we originally thought. We\u2019ve come quite a long way since then!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_0_4": "On that note, could you continue your work battling Grunts and helping Shadow Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_1": "I remember the first time we came across Shadow Pok\u00e9mon. It was heartbreaking to see the pain they were in, and I knew I had to do something.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_2": "As a Pok\u00e9mon Professor, I always want to contribute and help where I can. I may not be an accomplished battler like you, %PLAYERNAME%, but I can use my skills as a researcher and scientist to assist you on your journey.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_3": "That was why I started using Mysterious Components to build the prototype for the Rocket Radar. I hoped that Trainers like you could use it in our ongoing fight against Team GO Rocket and in our efforts to rescue more Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_1_4": "So let\u2019s get out there and do just that. I\u2019m grateful for your help, especially now. It\u2019s when times are toughest that we have the greatest opportunity to shine!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_0": "Thank you for purifying those Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m sure they are just as grateful as I am for your dedication.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_1": "Rescuing these Pok\u00e9mon was the main reason for my work on the Rocket Radar prototype.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_2": "Luckily, with the help of the team leaders and motivated Trainers like you, we were able to develop a functioning Rocket Radar and even start work on the Super Rocket Radar!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_3": "While a terrible situation, the Team GO Rocket invasion has been a thrilling adventure and research opportunity. I\u2019m anxious but excited to send our findings over to my mentor, Professor Oak. I\u2019ll be sure to let him know you said hello!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_2_4": "Now, it\u2019s time to get back to work. Let\u2019s test your battle skills, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_0": "I\u2019m always so impressed when Trainers use supereffective moves in battle. It\u2019s a sign of greatness when you see a Trainer using type effectiveness to their advantage.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_1": "All our work lately seems to have gotten Team GO Rocket\u2019s attention.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_3_2": "Reports are coming in that Sierra, Cliff, and Arlo are currently lurking in the area. You know what to do, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_0": "I knew you could do it, %PLAYERNAME%. The more you practice, the better you\u2019ll be able to take on those pesky Team GO Rocket Leaders. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re already scheming up their next plan after this defeat.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_1": "But now, Giovanni is waiting.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_2": "Using the Super Rocket Radar, track him down and defeat him. We must remain strong\u2014Giovanni is relentless. I wonder why he continues his invasion...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_3": "There are so many resources and Pok\u00e9mon in our world. His evil plans must have something to do with that. My research will continue, but we need you to face him.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_4_4": "Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%. We\u2019re counting on you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_0": "Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_1": "I will definitely be adding your victory as a note to the research I send over to Professor Oak.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_2": "I\u2019m sure he will be interested in anything you\u2019ve learned about Shadow Pok\u00e9mon and the continuing Team GO Rocket invasion, so please keep up your research and send it my way.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_3": "It may seem small, but every little bit helps!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq4_5_4": "I\u2019ll be in touch soon, since we know Team GO Rocket isn\u2019t likely to go anywhere. I know you\u2019ll be ready for whatever happens next!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You\u2019ve been instrumental in keeping back Team GO Rocket\u2019s forces.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_1": "Thanks to your hard work, we\u2019ve learned so much about this enemy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_2": "Team GO Rocket won\u2019t be going away anytime soon, so I\u2019m glad I can rely on you and your fellow Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_3": "While you\u2019ve done an amazing job so far, I\u2019m looking for more opportunities for you to hone your skills. Every good Trainer needs to stay on their toes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_0_4": "The Super Rocket Radar is in good hands with you on the task, but I wouldn\u2019t be a good Professor if I didn\u2019t make sure you were keeping up with Giovanni.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_0": "As expected, %PLAYERNAME%. Fantastic work!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_1": "Even though we\u2019ve been fighting off the threat of Team GO Rocket for some time, I\u2019m still concerned about the fact that Shadow Pok\u00e9mon keep appearing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_2": "It seems even more Pok\u00e9mon are being turned into Shadow Pok\u00e9mon despite our efforts. I\u2019ve been tracking this situation, and the numbers have almost tripled since all this began.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_3": "We need to keep pushing forward\u2014those Pok\u00e9mon need our help! Can I rely on you to purify more Shadow Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_1_4": "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see them shine with gratitude once you do!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_0": "Thank you for your efforts, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_1": "I\u2019m getting more and more concerned about the growing number of Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, so we need to keep fighting back against this threat.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_2": "Your talent has made it clear that you\u2019re ready for the next step in your preparations.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_2_3": "Use your battle skills to take on some Grunts. I think with some further observation, I can figure out what you need to do to make sure you\u2019re at your best!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_0": "All right! You should feel proud of your progress, %PLAYERNAME%. You consistently impress me and the team leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_1": "Candela could learn a thing or two from your battle prowess. I\u2019m sure the Team GO Rocket Leaders see you as a challenge.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_3_2": "Take that challenge to them, and drive them out of wherever they\u2019re holed up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, your preparations are complete\u2014you\u2019re ready to take on Giovanni.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_1": "It\u2019s time for you to use the Super Rocket Radar to track down the boss himself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_2": "You\u2019ve proven not only your strength in battle but also your compassion through saving and purifying Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_3": "Confront Giovanni with that strength and compassion, and I believe he won\u2019t be able to stop you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_4_4": "Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%. You\u2019ve shown Team GO Rocket just how strong your training has made you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_1": "Although your battle with Giovanni wasn\u2019t easy, the skills you\u2019ve learned through practice and patience have paid off.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_2": "But keep your wits about you, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_3": "Giovanni doesn\u2019t like to lose, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back soon to further his plans.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq5_5_4": "I know I can count on you when he returns, but until then, I\u2019ll work on finding some training opportunities for you so you can keep developing your skills.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_0": "Great to see you again, %PLAYERNAME%. You\u2019ve done such an amazing job with every challenge I\u2019ve given you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_1": "Congrats on coming so far as a Trainer! You constantly impress me with your skills.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_2": "But there are so many aspects to Pok\u00e9mon training! I think it\u2019s time to switch things up. I spoke with Spark, and he thought it would be good for you to focus some more on taking care of Pok\u00e9mon Eggs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_3": "Why not take a walk with your buddy Pok\u00e9mon after placing some Eggs into Incubators?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_0_4": "And be sure to rescue Shadow Pok\u00e9mon from any Team GO Rocket members you encounter, too. Those Pok\u00e9mon still need our help!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%. While you were busy, I met up with Blanche to discuss our research on recent developments with Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_1": "I had observed that Team GO Rocket somehow seemed to be making Shadow Pok\u00e9mon deal more damage with their attacks, though they also seem to take more damage in return now. My observations line up with Blanche\u2019s research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_2": "Both of us are concerned that despite our best efforts to push Team GO Rocket back, they\u2019re still gaining ground and putting more and more Pok\u00e9mon in danger.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_3": "While Blanche and I continue to investigate, can we depend on you to take down some more Grunts to slow Team GO Rocket down?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_1_4": "I\u2019m also going to assign you some tasks to test you as a Trainer. Battling Grunts alone won\u2019t keep your skills as sharp as they need to be to continue standing up to Team GO Rocket\u2019s leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_0": "Thanks for taking on those Grunts, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_1": "I was working with Candela to figure out what challenges we could give you to help you prepare for battles with other Trainers and in the GO Battle League. Those skills carry over to doing battle with the Team GO Rocket Leaders, after all!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_2": "Candela was very excited to find ways to keep you on your toes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_2_3": "Could you take on these challenges as part of your ongoing training?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_0": "You\u2019ve done the team leaders proud, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_1": "You took on those challenges like the skilled Trainer you are.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_2": "Great work. Now it\u2019s time to continue the battle against Team GO Rocket.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_3": "Your efforts to rescue and purify Shadow Pok\u00e9mon have certainly not gone unnoticed.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_3_4": "I\u2019ll be sure to share any new findings about Team GO Rocket\u2019s continued invasion as soon as they crop up, but right now, we should keep up the pressure on the Team GO Rocket Leaders. Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_0": "Taking on the Team GO Rocket Leaders is no easy task. They have proven to be difficult opponents for even the most accomplished Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_1": "One interesting thing to note is that I\u2019ve heard reports of Trainers rescuing Shiny Shadow Pok\u00e9mon from the Team GO Rocket Leaders.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_2": "This only further supports my suspicions that Team GO Rocket is gathering large numbers of Pok\u00e9mon if they\u2019ve been able to find Shiny ones to turn into Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_3": "There is definitely more that we need to learn about these foes and what their plans are.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_4_4": "For now, I need you to focus. It\u2019s time to take on Giovanni himself. You got this, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_0": "What an impressive victory, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_1": "Giovanni is one of the toughest opponents out there, but your continued efforts to improve let you rise to the challenge! After this, I\u2019m going to talk with the team leaders to discuss how we can further support you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_2": "You\u2019ve been an amazing part of the team, and we wouldn\u2019t be able to keep these villains at bay without your skills and dedication.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_3": "But we can\u2019t drop our guard while Team GO Rocket\u2019s around, so keep honing your battle techniques. I suggest challenging your fellow Trainers to battles and testing yourself in the GO Battle League.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq6_5_4": "I\u2019ll be in touch again soon, but until then, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s good to see you, though I\u2019m sorry it has to be under such dire circumstances.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_0_1": "What circumstances, you ask? Well, it appears as if Team GO Rocket is\u2014you guessed it\u2014stirring up more trouble!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like Grunts aren\u2019t involved in whatever new experiments Team GO Rocket is performing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_1": "As you might recall, Grunts use Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, which are Pok\u00e9mon that have been trained in unnatural and harmful ways to become incredibly powerful.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_1_2": "We\u2019ve heard rumors that Arlo was the one who spearheaded the Shadow Pok\u00e9mon program not long after he parted ways with Candela and Team Valor.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_1": "I noticed you caught a Larvitar. It\u2019s highly unusual to see one in the wild. Maybe it came from one of the Pok\u00e9mon Eggs that Team GO Rocket has been collecting...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_2": "While you were out battling Grunts, the team leaders and I discovered that Team GO Rocket has been collecting a mysterious kind of Pok\u00e9mon Egg we\u2019re calling Strange Eggs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_2_3": "It appears that mostly Poison- or Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon hatch from these Eggs. Let\u2019s save and hatch as many Strange Eggs as possible before Team GO Rocket is able to grow their ranks!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_0": "Great job defeating those leaders, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve saved some pretty cute Pok\u00e9mon in the process, if I do say so myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_1": "While you were off fighting Team GO Rocket, Spark and I did some more sleuthing and discovered that Sierra might actually be the brains behind the Strange Eggs!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_3_2": "It appears there\u2019s more to a Team GO Rocket Leader\u2019s duties than just taking over Pok\u00e9Stops and challenging Trainers to battle.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_4_1": "I managed to craft another Super Rocket Radar for you that\u2019ll help you track down Giovanni. But be careful\u2014according to a field report from Blanche and Candela, he\u2019s got Shadow Mewtwo with him!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq7_5_2": "This is probably not the last that we\u2019ll see of Giovanni or Team GO Rocket, but that also means there\u2019ll likely be more Strange Eggs to collect and Shadow Pok\u00e9mon to save! Let\u2019s get cracking, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_0_0": "Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m sorry to call you here so suddenly, but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s trouble afoot.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_0": "Welcome back, Trainer. I see you\u2019ve got yourself a Pidgeot and some Pidgeot Mega Energy!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_1": "As impressive as this Pok\u00e9mon is, though, it doesn\u2019t seem to be the Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon we've heard about in our reports.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_2": "Blanche\u2019s latest intel points to Giovanni being the one holding on to this mysterious Flying-type Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, so we need to track him down.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq8_3_3": "We believe our best bet at doing so is by first finding the Team GO Rocket Leaders\u2014and that\u2019s where you come in, Trainer. Let\u2019s GO!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_1": "That\u2019s not all\u2014I\u2019ve also heard rumors that a mysterious Pok\u00e9mon has been sighted wherever these rainbows appear. They say rainbows bring good luck, so why not follow one to the end? Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_0_2": "In all seriousness, why don\u2019t you go for a stroll and see for yourself? You never know what we might find!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m afraid I have some dire news... It sounds like Team GO Rocket\u2019s gotten wind of these sightings and have set out to catch the mysterious Pok\u00e9mon for themselves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_1": "Perhaps they're looking for a bit of good luck as well! Haha! Well, whatever their motive, we can\u2019t have them creating more powerful Shadow Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s time to do some investigating.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_1_2": "Knowing how large Team GO Rocket\u2019s forces are, I fear they may have already found it, no doubt leaving Shadow Pok\u00e9mon in their wake. Let\u2019s go catch some Shadow Pok\u00e9mon and see where they lead us!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_0": "Great job rescuing all those Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%! I wish we had time to celebrate, but I just discovered that Team GO Rocket caught up to our mysterious Pok\u00e9mon...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_1": "...and that it\u2019s none other than Ho-Oh, the Rainbow Pok\u00e9mon! But don\u2019t be discouraged! I truly believe that with enough determination, we can save it, just as we have in the past.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_2_2": "Let\u2019s prep for the gauntlet of battles ahead and gather more information about Ho-Oh\u2019s whereabouts by pursuing more Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_0": "Great job saving even more Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%! Through your efforts, we\u2019ve learned that Ho-Oh has been handed off to Giovanni and made into a Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_3_1": "For now, I want you to find and defeat Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra! Doing so will help us build a Super Rocket Radar that\u2019ll lead us right to Giovanni...and to Ho-Oh! Good luck!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_0": "Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! With a Super Rocket Radar in hand, we\u2019ll have no problem finding Giovanni. Defeating him in battle, however, is another story entirely...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_4_1": "Still! Seeing how you were able to beat his underlings, I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll come out on top\u2014and save Ho-Oh to boot!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_1": "Team GO Rocket never rests, so we should continue to be vigilant. In the meantime, why not get to know your newly saved Ho-Oh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rockethq9_5_2": "With the right care and a little luck, any Shadow Pok\u00e9mon can be purified! I wish you the best, %PLAYERNAME%, and I\u2019ll see you next time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Glad you\u2019re here. There\u2019s something I could use your help with today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_1": "As you know, I\u2019ve been away for a while.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_2": "I\u2019ve been thinking about how to shake off the doldrums. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks\u2014Pok\u00e9mon research! Specifically, I\u2019d like to learn about Roggenrola.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_3": "Roggenrola were first discovered a hundred years ago in an earthquake fissure, but the dirt that makes up their bodies is even older!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_4": "A Pok\u00e9mon made of earth is just the thing to get me feeling grounded again, don\u2019t you think? Not that I need an excuse to study Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_0_5": "Could you unearth some Roggenrola for me, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_0": "Great job, %PLAYERNAME%! Let\u2019s get a closer look at those Roggenrola.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_1": "Hm... Did you notice the hexagonal cavities on their bodies? Those are their ears, and deep inside is an energy core that makes Roggenrola slightly warm to the touch.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_2": "But don\u2019t stick your hand inside the cavity\u2014that\u2019s a surefire way to get on their bad side, and fast!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_3": "Is that from firsthand experience, you ask? W-well, any researcher worth his salt has to take the occasional risk.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_4": "You know, when Roggenrola evolve into Boldore and their energy is too great to be contained, they grow orange crystals on their bodies hard enough to smash diamonds.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_1_5": "Doesn\u2019t that sound like a sight, %PLAYERNAME%? Why don\u2019t you help Roggenrola evolve so you can see for yourself?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Boldore are looking great.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_1": "Their crystals\u2014amazing! If only I had some diamonds to put that whole \u201csmashing\u201d thing to the proof.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_2": "Well, while we can\u2019t conduct that particular experiment, I can still tell you more about Boldore.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_3": "Their crystals are actually masses of energy. Just one crystal fragment could provide enough fuel for a hundred dump trucks!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_2_4": "*sigh* Yet another theory we can\u2019t test ourselves. But if you help Boldore evolve, I\u2019ll tell you all about what they do with that power, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_0": "There you have it, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014a Gigalith of your own. Those crystals are even bigger now!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_1": "When Gigalith\u2019s orange crystals absorb solar energy, it\u2019s magnified internally and fired from its mouth. It\u2019s even capable of blowing away a mountain!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_2": "Because of its hefty horsepower, Gigalith is a popular partner for construction workers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_3": "I\u2019m sure you and Gigalith will get along great too, seeing as you\u2019re always out and about.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_4": "At any rate, thanks for helping me with my research today, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m feeling more like my old self already.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roggenrola_3_5": "Let\u2019s do this again soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_0": "Aha! I hoped we\u2019d have a run-in today, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_1": "I was out hiking earlier when I saw a quick flash of something in the trees\u2014something unusual.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_2": "I can\u2019t say for certain, but it may have been the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Zarude! Or possibly just some falling leaves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_3": "Either way, would you keep an eye\u2014or even two\u2014out for any unusual Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon while you\u2019re exploring?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, just the person I wanted to see!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_1": "I managed to spot our elusive friend again, and I can confirm that it\u2019s definitely a Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_2": "Unfortunately, it zipped away before I could get a closer look. Why don\u2019t you canvas the area?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_3": "In the meantime, I\u2019ll put my nose to my notes and see if I can\u2019t confirm its identity.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_0": "Excellent, you\u2019re back! I\u2019ve got fantastic news, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_1": "After digging into my archives, I can confirm that this mystery Pok\u00e9mon is indeed none other than the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Zarude!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_2": "They tend to move in packs, but I can\u2019t be certain how many we\u2019re dealing with. It doesn\u2019t matter, though. Either way, we must approach carefully!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_3": "I\u2019m going to dive back into research and uncover whatever I can about Zarude\u2019s behavior to help you prepare for this encounter.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I have some super interesting tidbits to share about our elusive friend, Zarude!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_1": "When the vines on its body are torn off, they enrich the soil, and cause plants to grow large and lush.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_2": "Interesting, right? And useful, too! Do be on the lookout for any unusually lush areas\u2014that could indicate a Zarude is close by!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_3": "You take care of that and let me know what you find. I\u2019ll take some more time to study up.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, thanks to your exemplary field work, we\u2019ve managed to locate the exact location of our Zarude.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_1": "I don\u2019t think I have to remind you to be careful\u2014it\u2019s incredibly aggressive, and other forest Pok\u00e9mon fear it. But I\u2019m sure a talented Trainer like you can earn its trust in no time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_2": "Just treat it like any other Pok\u00e9mon\u2014approach with patience and an open heart. Then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have yourself a steadfast new companion!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_3": "Great work so far, and good luck with what\u2019s to come!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_0": "Ahhh... Do you smell that, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_1": "I first caught a whiff of that curious aroma as I was out on my daily morning walk.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_2": "Upon investigation, I discovered that the scent was being produced by an uncommonly large group of Roselia that had assembled nearby.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_3": "Did you know you can judge a Roselia\u2019s health by the strength of its aroma? Well, let me tell you\u2014those were VERY healthy Roselia!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_4": "But while they certainly smell nice and look pretty, I advise you to take care when encountering them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_5": "The thorns on Roselia\u2019s head contain a vicious poison, and it can launch them at any opponent bold enough to try to steal the flowers on its arms. Every rose, as they say!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_0_6": "It\u2019s unusual to see so many Roselia in one place. Would you mind assisting me in researching this phenomenon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_1": "While you were out in the field, I did some reading on Roselia.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_2": "When it comes to Pok\u00e9mon, new discoveries are being made all the time\u2014so it\u2019s important to make sure your information is up to date.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_3": "Roselia, the Thorn Pok\u00e9mon, evolves from Budew, the Bud Pok\u00e9mon. Budew is sensitive to changes in temperature, and its bud is said to bloom when warmed by the sun.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_4": "It\u2019s also both Grass and Poison type, much like Roselia.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_1_5": "In reviewing these two Pok\u00e9mon, I remembered something tremendously exciting! I still need to conduct a bit more research before sharing my findings, however. Would you mind assisting me?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_0": "As aromatic Pok\u00e9mon go, we\u2019re pretty fortunate it\u2019s Roselia appearing en masse and not, say, Muk.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_1": "A big group of Muk gathered under the sun... The whole place would smell like baked garbage!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_2": "Oh! Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. Didn\u2019t realize you were back.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_3": "I found that interesting bit of information I wanted to share with you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_4": "According to my research, Roselia that drink nutritionally rich springwater are said to reveal rare coloration when they bloom.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_5": "Isn\u2019t that fascinating? Have you seen anything like that while you\u2019ve been out doing research?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_6": "You seem to have a lucky streak, so I wouldn\u2019t put it past you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_7": "Now that you\u2019re back, I\u2019d like you to evolve a Roselia with the Sinnoh Stone I gave you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_2_8": "I\u2019m excited to see the final Evolution in this line of Grass- and Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_0": "Great work, Trainer! Your Roselia has evolved into the Bouquet Pok\u00e9mon, Roserade!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_1": "It moves like a dancer and strikes with whips that are densely lined with poison thorns.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_2": "Oh, and have you noticed that each of Roserade\u2019s hands is a different color?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_3": "Each contains a different toxin. The poison in its right hand is quick acting, while the poison in its left hand is slow acting.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_4": "What an amazing Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_5": "Thanks for all your assistance today, Trainer. Documenting situations like this is essential to learning more about the Pok\u00e9mon in the world around us.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_roset_3_6": "Until next time, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_0_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, glad I caught you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_0_1": "I wanted to warn you about the feathers you may have seen scattered around. If you\u2019re considering picking one up\u2014don\u2019t. They\u2019re surprisingly sharp. Trust me.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_0_2": "I have a hypothesis about the identity of our feather flinger, but I\u2019d love an extra set of eyes to confirm it. Could you poke around and let me know what you find?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_0": "Aha! I was right! These feathers belong to Rowlet, the Grass Quill Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_1": "As a Grass type, Rowlet use photosynthesis to store up energy during the day.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_2": "Rowlet are typically active at night\u2014thus my initial hesitancy to pin this loose plumage on them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_3": "Though delightfully round and known to cuddle up in Trainers\u2019 backpacks, this Pok\u00e9mon shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Rowlet has mastered the art of deftly launching dagger-sharp feathers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_4": "Certainly not a Pok\u00e9mon whose feathers you want to ruffle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_1_5": "Consider my interest piqued! How about we see what we can learn about its Evolution next?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_0": "Just look at that dashing Dartrix, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_1": "Dartrix is known to be a bit of a dandy. It never slacks when it comes to cleaning its feathers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_2": "Thorough preening keeps it looking spiffy and its knife-like feathers\u2014appropriately dubbed \u201cblade quills\u201d\u2014nice and sharp.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_3": "It throws these quills at its enemies, striking their weak points with remarkable precision.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_2_4": "Talk about \u201cif looks could thrill\u201d!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_1": "Decidueye is an expert archer. It can nock and fire an arrow quill in a tenth of a second and pierce a pebble at distances over a hundred yards.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_2": "Despite its cool demeanor, when caught by surprise, it\u2019s seized by panic.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_3": "That happens to me from time to time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_4": "A colleague recently told me that Decidueye\u2019s appearance may be influenced by its environment. Isn\u2019t that fascinating?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rowlet_3_5": "Anyway, thanks for indulging my curiosity today, %PLAYERNAME%. It\u2019s always such a delight to research on the fly with you. Until next time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s great to see you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_0_1": "It\u2019s been a while, hasn\u2019t it? I\u2019m sure your skills are as sharp as ever, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to do a little warm-up anyway.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_0_2": "Why don\u2019t you start by seeing what Pok\u00e9mon are in the area?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_0_3": "I can\u2019t wait to see what you find!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Back already, eh? Let\u2019s take a look at the Pok\u00e9mon you caught.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_1": "Hmm... Well done! I knew you wouldn\u2019t have any problem getting back into the swing of things.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_2": "This is a great start\u2014so let\u2019s keep going! Why don\u2019t you head out and see what other Pok\u00e9mon you can discover?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_3": "While you do, I\u2019ll stay here and start researching the ones you caught already.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_1_4": "I\u2019m counting on you, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_1": "Thanks to your recent efforts, I\u2019ve got plenty of research topics to keep me occupied\u2014for now, anyway.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_2": "I\u2019ll be sure to reach out whenever I need a hand.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_3": "Until then, I hope you have a wonderful time exploring the world around you and meeting all sorts of incredible Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_rue_2_4": "Now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_0": "Good morning, %PLAYERNAME%! There sure seems to be a surplus of Sandshrew around today, don\u2019t you think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_1": "I\u2019m especially surprised to see both Sandshrew and Alolan Sandshrew appearing at once!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_2": "These two forms of Sandshrew usually prefer vastly different climates. Sandshrew usually make their homes in deserts and arid zones, where rain doesn\u2019t fall.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_3": "Alolan Sandshrew, on the other hand, are typically found in snowy mountains. What an uncommon sight for them to both be here together!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_0_4": "How about you spend some time with them and see what they\u2019re up to, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! That\u2019s an impressive number of Sandshrew you have in tow. I\u2019d love to take a closer look at them\u2014especially their shells.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_1": "Did you know that there\u2019s a traditional competition in Alolan festivals where Trainers slide Alolan Sandshrew across ice as far as possible?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_2": "How must the Sandshrew feel about that, I wonder!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_3": "The Sandshrew first found in the Kanto region are quite fascinating in their own right.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_4": "When their skin gets wrinkled from moisture, they head for volcanoes and lie flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat to dry themselves out.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_5": "It\u2019s truly incredible how different geography and climates can influence Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_1_6": "I\u2019d love to get an even closer look at both of these forms of Sandshrew. What do you say, %PLAYERNAME%? Let\u2019s get back out there!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_0": "You never disappoint, %PLAYERNAME%! Seeing all the Sandshrew together, don\u2019t they look like a tough bunch?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_1": "Sandshrew evolve into Sandslash, another hardy Pok\u00e9mon. Alolan Sandslash use their large, hooked claws to cut paths through deep snow as they run.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_2": "On snowy mountains, these Sandslash are faster than any other Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_3": "But Sandslash first found in Kanto are tough, too! They climb trees by hooking on with their sharp claws.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_4": "They even share the Berries they gather by dropping them down to Sandshrew waiting on the ground. If only I could gather Berries so easily...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_2_5": "Try and evolve Sandshrew to Sandslash for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your new Sandslash are an impressive sight\u2014befitting an impressive Trainer such as yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_1": "Up close, you can really appreciate the differences in the spikes of these Sandslash.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_2": "The drier the area Sandslash lives in, the harder and smoother their spikes feel.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_3": "Meanwhile, Alolan Sandslash have beautiful icy spikes that glisten in the light of dawn.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_4": "Thanks for helping me look into these Sandshrew today, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_5": "I\u2019ll keep studying Sandshrew and Sandslash in hopes of discovering more differences and similarities between them!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_6": "And I\u2019ll be sure to get in touch the next time I need a helping hand. Something tells me it won\u2019t be long!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sandt_3_7": "Until next time, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_searching_gold_june23_1_0": "Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! We\u2019ve got a golden day of research ahead of us. I can\u2019t wait to get started!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_searching_gold_june23_1_1": "Say, are you looking forward to finding one of these Pok\u00e9mon? I\u2019ve got a good feeling about them!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, exciting news! In my recent research into other regions, I learned of Paldea\u2014a vast, open place dotted with agricultural villages, port towns, and lively markets.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_1": "And beyond those settlements, Paldea has all sorts of magnificent places begging to be explored, from towering mountains to resplendent lakes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_2": "Most importantly for us, there are plenty of Pok\u00e9mon first discovered in Paldea for us to study!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_3": "Doesn\u2019t the very idea get your heart racing?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_0_4": "If you\u2019re up for it, I say we put our all-star teamwork to the proof by learning all there is to learn about them!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_1_0": "Great choice! You know, Sprigatito\u2019s a bit of a rascal. It\u2019s capricious and attention-seeking, to the point that it may sulk if it sees you giving attention to another Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_1_1": "As for its physical characteristics, its fluffy fur is similar in composition to plants, letting it create energy by absorbing sunlight.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_1_2": "And when Sprigatito kneads and rubs with its forepaws, a sweet aroma is released that can mesmerize those around it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_1_3": "While you contemplate that, how about you walk around and look for some Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_2_0": "Welcome back! How did it go? Exploring with a new Pok\u00e9mon is a great way to develop your bond. Now, here\u2019s another fun Sprigatito fact.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_2_1": "Sprigatito washes its face regularly to keep its fur from drying out. What a great self-care regimen!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_2_2": "I wonder how Sprigatito\u2019s Evolution, Floragato, behaves in comparison. Could you help your Sprigatito evolve so we can find out for ourselves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_3_0": "Wow! Amazing progress, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty you\u2019ll learn with a Pok\u00e9mon like Floragato at your side.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_3_1": "Did you know that its fur can become softer or harder depending on its mood? It can even be needle sharp when Floragato is ready to battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_3_2": "Speaking of battle, Floragato deftly wields a vine hidden beneath its long fur, slamming the hard flower bud against its opponents. I bet that smarts!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_3_3": "I can\u2019t wait to see how Floragato changes when it evolves into Meowscarada. Please come see me when it does!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_4_0": "Whoa! Meowscarada is one a-meow-zing Pok\u00e9mon! I\u2019ve heard that with skillful misdirection, it rigs foes with pollen-packed flower bombs, which it sets off before its foes realize what\u2019s going on.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_a_4_1": "That\u2019s quite the magic trick. I hope to see it firsthand someday\u2014from a safe distance, of course! But that\u2019s enough out of me\u2014you deserve a rest after all that research. Thanks for your help, as always, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_1_0": "Great choice! Fuecoco\u2019s one cheerful little chomper. Flickering atop its head is fire energy that is leaking out from inside its body\u2014and when Fuecoco gets excited, its head spouts more flames!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_1_1": "How about you match that enthusiasm as you walk around and look for Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_2_0": "Welcome back! How did it go? Exploring with a new Pok\u00e9mon is a great way to develop your bond. Now, here\u2019s another fun Fuecoco fact.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_2_1": "Fuecoco lies on warm rocks and uses the heat absorbed by its square-shaped scales to create fire energy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_2_2": "I wonder how Fuecoco\u2019s Evolution, Crocalor, behaves in comparison. Could you help your Fuecoco evolve so we can find out for ourselves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_3_0": "Wow! Amazing progress, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty you\u2019ll learn with a Pok\u00e9mon like Crocalor at your side.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_3_1": "Did you know that the combination of Crocalor\u2019s fire energy and overflowing vitality is what caused an egg-shaped fireball to appear on the Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s head?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_3_2": "What\u2019s more, the valve in Crocalor\u2019s flame sac is closely connected to its vocal cords. It utters a guttural cry as it spews flames every which way. Spicy!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_3_3": "I can\u2019t wait to see how Crocalor changes when it evolves into Skeledirge. Please come see me when it does!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_4_0": "Whoa! Skeledirge is one sizzlingly slick Pok\u00e9mon\u2014and yet somehow so serene! I\u2019ve heard that Skeledirge\u2019s gentle singing soothes the souls of all that hear it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_4_1": "And yet it burns its enemies to a crisp with flames of over 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit. It\u2019s, uh, certainly comforting to know you\u2019re on the same team!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_b_4_2": "But that\u2019s enough out of me\u2014you deserve a rest after all that research. Thanks for your help, as always, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_branch_0": "Which Pok\u00e9mon first discovered in Paldea would you like to join you on your adventure, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_1_0": "Great choice! Quaxly is an earnest and tidy Pok\u00e9mon. Perhaps you\u2019re the sort of Trainer who likes it when everything is neatly in place\u2014and for Quaxly, that place is at your side!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_1_1": "Quaxly\u2019s feathers secrete a gel that repels water and grime, so its body is always glossy. And get a gander at that coif atop its head! So luxurious.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_1_2": "I\u2019m suddenly inspired to tidy things up around here. While I\u2019m doing that, why don\u2019t you walk around and look for Water-type Pok\u00e9mon, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_2_0": "Welcome back! How did it go? Exploring with a new Pok\u00e9mon is a great way to develop your bond. Now, here\u2019s another fun Quaxly fact.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_2_1": "This Pok\u00e9mon migrated to Paldea from distant lands long ago. Its strong legs let it easily swim around in even fast-flowing rivers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_2_2": "I wonder how Quaxly\u2019s Evolution, Quaxwell, behaves in comparison. Could you help your Quaxly evolve so we can find out for ourselves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_3_0": "Wow! Amazing progress, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty you\u2019ll learn with a Pok\u00e9mon like Quaxwell at your side.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_3_1": "Did you know that these Pok\u00e9mon constantly run through shallow waters to train their legs, then compete with each other to see which of them kicks most gracefully?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_3_2": "The hardworking Quaxwell observes people and Pok\u00e9mon from various regions and incorporates their movements into its own dance routines. So studious!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_3_3": "I can\u2019t wait to see how Quaxwell changes when it evolves into Quaquaval. Please come see me when it does!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_4_0": "Whoa! Quaquaval is one mesmerizing Pok\u00e9mon! This Pok\u00e9mon uses its powerful legs to perform striking dances from far-off lands. And that\u2019s not all those legs can do\u2014I\u2019ve heard that a single kick from a Quaquaval can send a truck rolling. Yikes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season12_c_4_1": "But that\u2019s enough out of me\u2014you deserve a rest after all that research. Thanks for your help, as always, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s good to see you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_1": "As you know, I\u2019ve recently been conducting research on several different regions in the world of Pok\u00e9mon. Along the way, I came across some books that collected stories and legends from various regions.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_2": "One of these tomes told of three Legendary Pok\u00e9mon from the Unova region\u2014a trio that seem to be capable of changing formes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_3": "Needless to say, that piqued my interest, and I became so enveloped in my research that I even began seeing those three Legendary Pok\u00e9mon in my dreams!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_4": "Which brings me to why I called you here. Can you help me with some research, Trainer? I was thinking we could start by catching some Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon\u2014you know, just to give ourselves a sturdy foundation to build from.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_0_5": "...Get it? Sturdy? Because they\u2019re...Rock-type? A-anyway, I\u2019d appreciate the help. Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer. Now that we\u2019ve established a foundation for our research, we need to narrow our focus.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_1": "There are three stories I want to investigate, so I think the best approach is to focus on one story at a time and see what we can learn.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_2": "My hope is to discover as much as we can about these Pok\u00e9mon, so that when we see clues or signs of their appearance, we\u2019re as prepared as possible!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_3": "This first story tells of a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon called Landorus. The story says that lands visited by Landorus yield such bountiful crops that it\u2019s been hailed as \u201cThe Guardian of the Fields.\u201d",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_4": "Landorus seems to have two formes: Incarnate Forme, and the very rarely seen Therian Forme. I haven\u2019t been able to find any imagery depicting the latter, but every source I\u2019ve read agrees on its existence!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_1_5": "For now, why don\u2019t we research Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon? Maybe in doing so we can better equip ourselves to identify Landorus\u2019s Therian Forme when the time comes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_0": "Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I think we\u2019ve gained a better understanding of Landorus after studying Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_1": "And is that a Drilbur you\u2019ve got there? I dig it! ...Haha! Sorry, sorry.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_2": "Anyway, since we\u2019ve explored all our leads on Landorus for the moment, what do you say we move on to another Pok\u00e9mon from my dream?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_3": "Let\u2019s focus on Tornadus next. The texts say Tornadus expels massive energy from its tail, causing severe storms, and that its power is great enough to blow houses away.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_2_4": "Like Landorus, Tornadus also has both Incarnate and Therian Formes. Hmm... Maybe researching Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon in the area is our best bet for now? Let\u2019s give it a shot, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_0": "Excellent work, Trainer! Thanks for documenting that information about Tornadus. It seems you even found yourself a darling Ducklett along the way! Is it all it\u2019s quacked up to be? Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_1": "I think we\u2019ve learned everything we can about Tornadus for now. Its Therian Forme is still a mystery, but hopefully not for long!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_2": "Before we start investigating the final Legendary Pok\u00e9mon from my dream, I need to share something...strange.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_3": "You see, I\u2019d been running myself a bit ragged with research, so I stopped for an afternoon nap. In the resulting dream, I saw those three Unovan Legendary Pok\u00e9mon again, clear as crystal. But then, the whole dream just started...fading.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_4": "It was almost like something was eating the dream itself. I\u2019m still not sure what to make of it all, but let's stay on the lookout for anything suspicious. I have a hunch this may be the work of a Pok\u00e9mon nearby.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_5": "For now, though, let\u2019s continue our research and turn our attention to the last of the three Unovan Legendary Pok\u00e9mon detailed in those stories\u2014Thundurus.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_6": "Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pok\u00e9mon, and its story also references both Incarnate and Therian Formes. The spikes on its tail are said to discharge immense bolts of lightning.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_3_7": "For the sake of consistency, let\u2019s go ahead and research Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon in the area as we compile our notes on Thundurus.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_0": "Ah, there you are, %PLAYERNAME%. I have something big to share!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_1": "But first, I want to thank you for all your hard work collecting information on Landorus, Tornadus, and Thundurus.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_2": "I feel confident that when the time comes, you\u2019ll be prepared to encounter any of these amazing Legendary Pok\u00e9mon\u2014regardless of which forme they appear in.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_3": "Now\u2014do you remember that strange experience I had where my dream began fading inexplicably? I think I may have finally uncovered the cause.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_4": "While consulting the Pok\u00e9dex for possible culprits, I came across an entry for a Pok\u00e9mon called Munna. It\u2019s known as the Dream Eater Pok\u00e9mon\u2014so you can see why it caught my eye!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_5": "Munna is said to eat the dreams of both people and Pok\u00e9mon, expelling mist as a result. The mist is pink if the dream is pleasant, and black if it\u2019s a nightmare.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_6": "I was pretty pleased to be dreaming of those Unovan Legendary Pok\u00e9mon again, so I suspect Munna\u2019s mist was nice and rosy that day!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season2_4_7": "Munna seems like a fascinating Pok\u00e9mon, and I can\u2019t wait to research it more. I hope you\u2019ll give me a hand when the time comes, Trainer! Now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. A new adventure is about to begin!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_1": "Not long ago, various Legendary Pok\u00e9mon began emerging from mysterious rings that suddenly appeared in the sky. After some research, we discovered it was Hoopa, the Mischief Pok\u00e9mon, that was responsible.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_2": "Hoopa\u2019s rings allow it to teleport things\u2014including itself\u2014wherever it wants. That power makes it hard to track down, but for some reason, Hoopa seems to keep returning to this area.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_3": "How do I know? Well, I was doing some lab work recently when my glasses were lifted straight off my head. Spark was there assisting me, and he said he saw a small, lavender-colored hand emerge from a ring and snatch my glasses. Pretty cheeky, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_4": "Luckily, he and Candela managed to retrieve my spectacles by chasing down the rings that were popping up at random around my mobile lab. So, at least I can still see. Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_5": "Needless to say, I\u2019m still not sure why Hoopa\u2019s here. Tracking it down has been difficult, but with your help, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll crack the case in no time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_0_6": "For now, why don\u2019t you try using an Incense to see what Pok\u00e9mon you can find in the area?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_0": "... ... ...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_1": "BOO! Haha, did I scare you? Not too badly, I hope.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_2": "Let\u2019s continue our investigation into these eerie events. Don\u2019t worry\u2014I won\u2019t send you into any rickety mansions or foggy forests.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_3": "I was actually doing some research near a forest myself recently, and I found a rather odd-looking tree. I\u2019ve learned over the years to trust my gut when something seems strange in the field\u2014chances are it\u2019s a Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_4": "I couldn\u2019t help but indulge my curiosity, and I stepped toward the tree to observe it more closely. As soon as I did, the tree pivoted on its roots and stared me down with a single red eye!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_5": "It didn\u2019t take long for me to realize I was standing before a Trevenant, the Elder Tree Pok\u00e9mon. Trevenant will trap people who harm their forest, never allowing them to leave.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_6": "It must have sensed that I was just there for research because it turned back around and ignored me. Its attention then turned to the many Phantump gathered around it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_7": "That\u2019s when I realized that Trevenant was harvesting Berries from the nearby trees to feed the Phantump! Trevenant is known to offer great kindness to forest-dwelling Pok\u00e9mon, and it was lovely to witness it myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_8": "Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon can seem frightening at first glance, but look a little closer and you\u2019ll find they\u2019re full of surprises. I\u2019m sure the same goes for Hoopa!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_10_9": "I have a feeling there\u2019s more to Hoopa than its penchant for mischief. Maybe we\u2019ll find some answers after we conduct some more research on Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_11_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! As we close out our spooky investigations, I have a feeling there are some bright things on the horizon for us to explore together soon. I\u2019ll be sure to let you know when I have something to share!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_0": "Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back. It\u2019s around this time of year that nights in the Northern Hemisphere begin growing longer and longer. The sun shines brighter while it\u2019s up, though, so it\u2019s a pretty fair trade!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_1": "If you ask me, this is a prime opportunity to ponder the power of light and darkness\u2014both literally and metaphorically. I wonder what darkness our little friend Hoopa has had to overcome? I have a feeling its mischievous reputation may hang over it like a shadow at times.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_2": "What\u2019s more, I can\u2019t help but wonder how and why its power was confined.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_3": "Pok\u00e9mon are an endless source of mystery. We may never know all their secrets, but it\u2019s a researcher\u2019s job to shine a light into the darkest depths of the unknown and illuminate whatever answers we can!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_4": "For me, darkness is an opportunity to learn something new. To make discoveries! We\u2019ve learned so much about Hoopa in our research, and in some ways, I think we may have learned a bit about ourselves, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_12_5": "But enough of my rambling! How about you head on out there and enjoy the light, %PLAYERNAME%? You\u2019ve earned it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_0": "I\u2019m glad to see you again, Trainer! I was out on a walk and got to thinking about your journey with Hoopa thus far.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_1": "It seems that Hoopa\u2019s really taken a shine to you. Do you think it may show us more of its power soon? A professor can dream, I suppose.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_13_2": "Why don\u2019t you check back again in a bit, %PLAYERNAME%, after you\u2019ve spent a tad more time with Hoopa.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_0": "I\u2019m glad to see you, %PLAYERNAME%. I wish I had better news, but it looks like Team GO Rocket is stirring up trouble once again!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_1": "While out on patrol, Spark and Candela overheard some Team GO Rocket Grunts discussing the organization\u2019s next move. They want to capture Hoopa! It seems their orders came straight from Giovanni himself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_2": "I shudder to think that all this time Giovanni may have been lurking in the shadows just behind us, reaping the benefits of our research. Scheming as we studied Hoopa...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_3": "There\u2019s no time to lose\u2014we have to stop them! Hoopa Unbound is incredibly powerful, and I have no doubt that Giovanni intends to use it for some sinister purpose.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_4": "You know better than most, %PLAYERNAME%: Hoopa may be capable of terrifying things, but it\u2019s still a Pok\u00e9mon. It must be protected!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_14_5": "We\u2019ve also gotten word that Giovanni has turned another Legendary Pok\u00e9mon into a Shadow Pok\u00e9mon! The team leaders and I will do what we can, but we\u2019ll need your help if we\u2019re to defeat Giovanni, save the Legendary Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, and keep Hoopa safe.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_0": "Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve successfully defeated Team GO Rocket yet again and saved another Legendary Shadow Pok\u00e9mon\u2014and Hoopa, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_1": "Speaking of Hoopa, I have a sneaking suspicion that because of your kindness, we might just be lucky enough to witness it as Hoopa Unbound someday soon. What a sight that will be, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_15_2": "We\u2019ve come a long way in our research, and unlocking Hoopa\u2019s true power may be the final trial in this mysterious saga. Are you ready, Trainer? Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_0": "As with all great mysteries, solving this will take time, patience, and trust. I\u2019ll need to work alone at some points, but I promise I\u2019ll return to share my findings and help propel us forward.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_1": "You just keep exploring the world as you always do. You never know what you might find!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_1_2": "I\u2019ll report back here once I have more information on Hoopa. Thanks in advance for your help, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s so good to see you again. Have you managed to spot Hoopa anywhere?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_1": "Although some think of Hoopa as a mischievous troublemaker, really all it wants to do is have fun!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_2": "Speaking of fun, it seems Hoopa had a blast filling up my mobile lab with Pinap Berries. Maybe it spotted me happily digging into some during my lunch break and decided I could use a few more.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_3": "It was a bit of a surprise when I opened the lab door and piles of Pinap Berries poured out! It took a while to clean everything up\u2014but my lab did smell amazing afterward, so it wasn\u2019t all bad.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_4": "It was nice having an excuse to clean\u2014not to mention I have enough Pinap Berries to last me for days. I might even make some jam...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_5": "Anyway, Hoopa sure has seemed a lot friendlier these days, hasn\u2019t it? I think it\u2019s been having lots of fun interacting with us. Maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s been bringing all sorts of surprises into our world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_2_6": "Who knows\u2014you might be able to catch it now!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_0": "Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! I can't believe you caught Hoopa!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_1": "Normally I\u2019d say we\u2019re done with our research, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Hoopa continued to cause mischief.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_2": "It seems there\u2019s still much for us to learn about this Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_3": "By the way, I\u2019ve noticed that some Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon have been appearing around my lab. Could Hoopa\u2019s presence be the cause?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_3_4": "Perhaps we\u2019ll be able to use this as an opportunity to research Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon, including Hoopa. I\u2019ll have to investigate this phenomenon further, and I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019ve learned more. Until next time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019ve noticed an increase in the number of Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon appearing around my mobile lab of late.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_1": "Whenever something like this happens, I can\u2019t help but get excited about researching the cause!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_2": "As you may recall, the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Hoopa is a Psychic and Ghost type. I have a hunch its recent appearances might be causing the uptick in Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon in these parts.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_3": "What\u2019s more, I believe we may be able to learn more about Hoopa by researching other Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon. There\u2019s one in particular that\u2019s caught my attention: Inkay.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_4": "My colleague in the Kalos region told me that Inkay is known as the Revolving Pok\u00e9mon, and that it evolves in a unique way.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_5": "I\u2019m ashamed to say I\u2019ve forgotten the details, but I do remember him saying \u201cupside-down\u201d several times during his explanation. If only I could remember why...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_4_6": "Maybe it\u2019s my one-track mind speaking, but I immediately think of Hoopa when I hear \u201cupside-down\u201d\u2014because its appearance turned our world right on its head! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_0": "Hey, Trainer! Have you noticed that Hoopa has continued to cause mischief? Its tricks are always unexpected, but I do feel like Hoopa\u2019s brought some welcome color to our lives.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_1": "Speaking of colorful things, I\u2019ve heard reports that there\u2019s a certain Pok\u00e9mon nearby that\u2019s known to have multiple appearances. Keep your eyes peeled for me, won\u2019t you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_5_2": "In the meantime, I\u2019m going to analyze everything we\u2019ve learned about Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon thus far. Hopefully it\u2019ll point us in the right direction to continue our research on Pok\u00e9mon forms\u2014and Hoopa!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019ve noticed that some Pok\u00e9mon wearing costumes have been appearing around my lab lately. Isn\u2019t it fun to change up your look every once in a while?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_1": "Speaking of, have you encountered any Furfrou yet? Also known as the Poodle Pok\u00e9mon, Furfrou is famous for the variety of looks it can achieve when a Trainer trims its coat\u201410 in all!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_6_2": "Why don\u2019t we stay on the lookout for Furfrou and see if we can learn more about changing its appearance? Who knows\u2014maybe we\u2019ll learn more about other Pok\u00e9mon along the way!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_0": "Great job catching that Furfrou, Trainer! Did you know there are also other Pok\u00e9mon that\u2019re known to change their appearance? That includes one we\u2019ve spent a lot of time researching lately: Hoopa.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_1": "Hoopa is known to have two forms. So far, you and I have seen it as Hoopa Confined, but I hear its power increases astronomically when it becomes Hoopa Unbound.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_2": "I wonder if we\u2019ll ever get to witness it ourselves. I suppose all we can do for now is continue our research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_3": "In fact, Blanche has been receiving reports of some spooky occurrences out in the field. We\u2019re not quite sure what the cause is, but like all things lately, we can\u2019t rule out Hoopa\u2019s involvement.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_4": "Hoopa\u2019s no stranger to mischief, and you never know how it\u2019ll use its rings next, so I think further investigation is in order.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_7_5": "I\u2019ll be sure to share more details with you when I have them, %PLAYERNAME%. Now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s nice to see a friendly face\u2014because I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of spooky Pok\u00e9mon staring at me lately!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_1": "Do you think this might be Hoopa\u2019s doing? Hoopa\u2019s known to transport Pok\u00e9mon and people to different places with its rings, so maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_2": "After all those Legendary Pok\u00e9mon appeared during this year\u2019s GO Fest\u2014as well as those Pok\u00e9mon first found in Galar that appeared more recently\u2014I\u2019d say Hoopa\u2019s involvement here is more than likely.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_8_3": "Perhaps we can learn more about Hoopa by studying the Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon that have begun to show up nearby. Mind giving me a hand, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_9_0": "Thanks for conducting that research, Trainer. We certainly know more than we did, but not enough to explain why these spooky occurrences are still...well, occurring.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season4_9_1": "Let\u2019s do a bit more research on Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon then, shall we?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s great to see you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_1": "I can\u2019t thank you and Rhi enough for bringing me back from beyond the Ultra Wormhole. The two of you are quite the team!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_2": "As exhilarating as it was to explore a different dimension, it wasn\u2019t without its challenges. Thoughts of home kept me calm\u2014you, Meltan, the team leaders...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_3": "Maybe it was the sheer strength of those memories, but more than once it seemed almost like I was being surrounded by a protective presence\u2014warm like the sun and calm like the moon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_4": "Who knows\u2014maybe there really was something watching out for me! Our world can\u2019t be the only one full of mysteries, after all.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_5": "Speaking of mysteries, I have a new one to share with you, %PLAYERNAME%. Since my return, a small, gaseous Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve never seen before has been hanging around my lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_6": "It seems friendly, but where did it come from?  Did it follow me from beyond the Ultra Wormhole? Could it be an Ultra Beast?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_0_7": "Considering that possibility, I think it would be best if you work with Rhi to raise this Pok\u00e9mon. Naturally, I\u2019ll be eager to hear anything you may learn in the process.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_0": "Greetings, %PLAYERNAME%. So, Professor Willow confirmed he felt a presence like this Legendary Pok\u00e9mon on the other side of the Ultra Wormhole?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_1": "It would seem my theory was correct, then. A Pok\u00e9mon of its kind protected Professor Willow during his disappearance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_2": "Pok\u00e9mon are such wonderful creatures. I will have to make note of this behavior.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_3": "You\u2019re marvelous too, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014a kind and strong Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_4": "I am at ease knowing that someone so capable is keeping an eye on the Ultra Beasts.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_5": "And more importantly, I am honored to call someone like you a friend.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_6": "Ahem. Now, I believe a status report is in order.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_7": "This world is sufficiently capable of defending itself against threats from the Ultra Wormholes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_8": "However, we have yet to discern the origin of\u2014or inciting force behind\u2014the Ultra Wormholes. I ran some tests as you conversed with Professor Willow and determined that our Pok\u00e9mon friend here is not responsible.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_10_9": "At least one mystery yet persists. It would seem more adventures lie on the horizon for us, %PLAYERNAME%. Until our next!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_0": "Greetings, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. With the Ultra Beasts presently at bay, now is an opportune moment to reflect on our time together thus far.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_1": "The Ultra Wormholes and the dangers they pose were my primary concerns upon arriving in this world. But now, I find myself equally invested in developing our relationship.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_2": "In light of our new rapport, perhaps it is time I reintroduced myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_3": "I am Rhi of the GO Ultra Recon Squad. It is a pleasure to be your friend, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_4": "Is there any objective I may assist you with today?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_5": "Your Professor Willow has asked us to rear and study a peculiar Pok\u00e9mon, is it? Understood.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_6": "Ah. I have heard tales of such a Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_7": "Its gentle glow is impossible to mistake. I believe this Pok\u00e9mon is called...Cosmog.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_1_8": "Come\u2014let us show Cosmog the beauty of this world.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_0": "Hm? You wish to know more of Cosmog?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_1": "Some have said that in ages past, it was known as the child of the stars.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_2": "Beyond that, few details are known.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_3": "Perhaps you and I can shed some light on this peculiar Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_4": "Earning its trust seems like a logical first step.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_5": "Do you think Cosmog would feel closer to us if it were given a nickname?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_6": "Its visage reminds me of outer space... A nebula, perhaps.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_7": "But never mind my musings. I will leave the decision to you, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_2_8": "No matter the name, I am eager to learn more of Cosmog as we become better acquainted.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you, as always.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_1": "How have you and Rhi been? Have you two learned any more about that mysterious Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_2": "Rhi recognizes it, you say? And its name is Cosmog? Incredible! Having a bit of extra-dimensional help really expands our knowledge base.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_3": "Still, when it comes to Pok\u00e9mon research, nothing beats firsthand observation. Have you gleaned anything interesting during your time with Cosmog, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_4": "Hmm... I see.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_5": "Sounds like Cosmog\u2019s curious, but not very cautious.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_6": "I can relate to throwing caution to the wind, but when you\u2019re light enough to be blown away by the slightest breeze... Well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_7": "It\u2019s a good thing you and Rhi are there to make sure Cosmog is safe\u2014just like you were for me!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_3_8": "Anyhow, the more time you spend with Cosmog, the more we\u2019ll learn. Let me know when you make more discoveries!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_0": "%PLAYERNAME%. Greetings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_1": "So, Cosmog has evolved into Cosmoem.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_2": "Do not be troubled by its current state.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_3": "This is its natural biology at work.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_4": "Though Cosmoem lies inert, energy is building within its core.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_5": "I suspect it is preparing to evolve and will become active again in due time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_6": "Precisely when that will happen is beyond my knowledge, however.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_7": "Once Cosmoem evolves, I wonder... Wait. I am struck by a thought. Recall how Willow spoke of a presence \u201cwarm like the sun and calm like the moon.\u201d",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_8": "I apologize for the abrupt interruption of our conversation, %PLAYERNAME%, but I must make some notes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_4_9": "Please continue your exploration in my absence and apprise Professor Willow of Cosmog\u2019s evolution into Cosmoem.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, you\u2019re back already! How\u2019s Cosmog\u2014",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_1": "Whoa! Who\u2019s that Pok\u00e9mon? Did Cosmog evolve?! Just look at that lustrous shell!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_2": "Rhi\u2019s hypothesis is that this \u201cCosmoem\u201d will stay in this state until it\u2019s ready to evolve? Excellent theory!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_3": "It\u2019s definitely easier to get an up-close look at a Pok\u00e9mon holding still, but what do you think is going on in Cosmoem\u2019s mind? Is it asleep? Maybe it\u2019s dreaming of adventuring with you and Rhi!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_4": "What else will we learn once it \u201cbecomes active,\u201d as Rhi put it? What kind of Pok\u00e9mon could it become? Unlike our serene friend here, my mind\u2019s buzzing with questions and possibilities!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_5_5": "I can\u2019t wait to see what mysteries we\u2019ll unravel, %PLAYERNAME%! Keep taking good care of Cosmoem until then.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_6_0": "Still in a holding pattern with Cosmoem, %PLAYERNAME%? Not to worry\u2014sometimes slow and steady is the way to go. I\u2019ll be waiting right here, so come see me when you have an update to share.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_7_0": "Oh? Did you see that, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_7_1": "Cosmoem seems to be stirring.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_7_2": "It appears the time has finally come.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_7_3": "We\u2019ll soon be able to observe the splendor of Cosmoem evolving with our own eyes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_0": "In...incredible! Cosmoem has evolved!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_1": "Splendid! Scintillating, even\u2014to witness such a stunning sight firsthand.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_2": "This Pok\u00e9mon holds the power to open Ultra Wormholes. Others of its kind frequently join the GO Ultra Recon Squad in our investigations. They assist us in traversing dimensions.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_3": "Though it remains to be seen how this particular specimen initially made its way here...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_4": "I\u2019d like to observe how it acclimates to this world in its new form. Our friend has changed greatly since we first came across it as Cosmog. And you must show Professor Willow this dazzling development.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_8_5": "Do be sure to share his impressions with me.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Great to see you\u2014and that majestic Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve brought with you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_1": "Unless I\u2019ve gotten my wires crossed, I believe that\u2019s a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in Alola. How did you come across it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_2": "Wha\u2014it evolved from Cosmoem?!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_3": "I\u2019m awestruck! And...struck with the exact same calm, warm feeling I had on the other side of the Ultra Wormhole.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_4": "Hmm... Could a Pok\u00e9mon of this species have been looking out for me?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_5": "Funny, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m always thinking about how we can protect Pok\u00e9mon. But it looks like this time, a Pok\u00e9mon protected me!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_6": "I\u2019ve got one more friend to be thankful for, aside from you and Rhi.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_7": "I knew leaving Cosmog with you two was the right choice. With your encouragement and guidance, it\u2019s become something truly Legendary!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_8": "Do me a favor, would you? Keep adventuring together and tell me all about your exploits when you have a chance.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_season8_9_9": "As for me, well... I think it\u2019s about time I put my old lab coat back on. Don\u2019t you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_1": "I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. Get this\u2014there\u2019ve been sightings of Shaymin in the area!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_2": "Well, it might be more accurate to say \u201cpotential sightings,\u201d as I\u2019ve yet to verify the information.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_3": "Shaymin lives in common flower patches but is rarely noticed. It\u2019s often mistaken for a flowering plant when curled up\u2014what unique behavior for a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_4": "I can\u2019t help but wonder if we\u2019d know more about Shaymin if only we were a little more observant.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_0_5": "Let\u2019s put that theory to the test and see what we can learn taking a good look around the area, shall we?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_0": "How did it go, %PLAYERNAME%? Any chance you ran into Shaymin while you were out?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_1": "No? Well, that\u2019s OK! I see you got some good snapshots of other Pok\u00e9mon in the meantime.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_2": "Hmm... That gets me thinking. As you might know, the flowers all over Shaymin burst into bloom if it\u2019s lovingly hugged and senses gratitude.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_3": "I hypothesize that if we take the time to share some thankfulness, we\u2019ll attract Shaymin\u2019s attention.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_1_4": "Not that we need any excuse to celebrate Pok\u00e9mon, I say! In fact, how about we appreciate them in photo form with some more snapshots, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_2_0": "Your snapshots look great, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve got a real knack for catching Pok\u00e9mon\u2014both in Pok\u00e9 Balls and on camera!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_2_1": "And y\u2019know what else you\u2019ve got a knack for? Pok\u00e9mon battles!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_2_2": "I\u2019m sure you already know that one of the ways you can keep your team in tip-top shape is by powering up your Pok\u00e9mon. Why don\u2019t you do that and come see me when you\u2019re done?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_1": "I was just thinking about Shaymin again. One of the many things that makes Shaymin so special is that it has two known forms.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_2": "I refer, of course, to its Land Forme and Sky Forme. Land Forme Shaymin is Grass-type, but when it turns into Sky Forme Shaymin, it becomes Grass- and Flying-type.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_3": "Some say that it transforms when it takes in the scent of a rare flower.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_4": "Perhaps you\u2019re wondering what would happen if a human took a whiff. A researcher from long ago tried just that, but alas, his body remained unchanged.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_5": "Ah well. Not all hypotheses hold water. That\u2019s just part of the scientific process!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_3_6": "And speaking of learning, why don\u2019t you spend some time with other Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon and Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon? Maybe they\u2019ll inspire you to make some hypotheses of your own!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_4_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. Now you\u2019ve got even more Pok\u00e9mon to bring along on your journey!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_4_1": "In the spirit of Shaymin being the Gratitude Pok\u00e9mon, let\u2019s show some gratitude to our old and newfound friends alike.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_4_2": "How about taking some snapshots with your Pok\u00e9mon or feeding them some tasty Berries? I know my beloved Meltan always enjoys a snack\u2014maybe your Pok\u00e9mon are the same!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_0": "Your Pok\u00e9mon are positively glowing, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019m sure they appreciated that extra quality time with you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_1": "The more time I spend with Pok\u00e9mon, the more I appreciate all their unique qualities.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_2": "For example, Torchic is oh-so-cuddly. It has fire burning inside it, so hugging it is lovely and warm. Then there\u2019s Mudkip, who contains amazing power\u2014it can crush rocks bigger than itself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_3": "I could also wax poetic about Treecko, whose feet are covered by countless tiny spikes, enabling it to walk on walls and ceilings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_5_4": "And that\u2019s just a scant three Pok\u00e9mon! I\u2019d love to hear your observations too, %PLAYERNAME%. What unique Pok\u00e9mon and traits can you observe?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Yay\u2014it\u2019s Shaymin!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_1": "It looks happy\u2014I daresay even grateful\u2014to be in the care of an exemplary Trainer like you!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_2": "And as long as we\u2019re on the subject, I want you to know I\u2019m incredibly thankful you helped me with my research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_3": "I know it\u2019s not always easy, but I can\u2019t tell you enough how much I appreciate your contributions to my studies.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_4": "Studies that never end, I might add. Haha. So rest up, and I\u2019ll be in contact again soon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shaymin_global_6_5": "Let\u2019s GO...with gratitude!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_0": "Hey there %PLAYERNAME%! Hope you\u2019ve been well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_1": "The strangest thing happened last night: I noticed a veritable bevy of bobbing, blinking lights bouncing around at the far end of a nearby park\u2014but by the time I\u2019d run over, the area was empty and dark.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_2": "I have a feeling those flickering lights may somehow be connected to an Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon, but I can\u2019t be sure!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_0_3": "How about we do a little investigating, hm? Maybe those Pok\u00e9mon are still nearby.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_0": "Well, would you look at that! It\u2019s Shinx, the Flash Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_1": "Considering all I\u2019ve heard about this cute little creature, I have a theory.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_2": "Shinx sends signals to others of its kind by shaking the tip of its lit-up tail.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_3": "Last night\u2019s anomaly was likely a group of Shinx having a chat!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_4": "Now that you\u2019ve caught a Shinx, why don\u2019t we do some research into its Evolution, Luxio?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_1_5": "Strong electricity courses through the tips of Luxio\u2019s sharp claws. What a shocking combination! Let\u2019s learn more about it, shall we?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_0": "Well done, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014you\u2019ve got yourself a Luxio!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_1": "Also known as the Spark Pok\u00e9mon, Luxio can receive a bit of other Luxio\u2019s electricity by joining their tails together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_2": "So, Shinx can use their tails to communicate with one another, and Luxio can gather their tails together to collectively generate powerful electricity. Fascinating!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_2_3": "I wonder what else there is to learn about this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s Evolutionary line. How about you evolve your Luxio and we find out for ourselves!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_0": "Ah, Luxray, the Gleam Eyes Pok\u00e9mon! When its eyes gleam gold, it can spot hidden prey\u2014even through thick walls.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_1": "But seeing through solid objects uses a lot of its electricity, so Luxray sleep for long periods of time to store up energy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_2": "What an electrifying revelation! We\u2019ve learned a lot about Shinx and its Evolutions, but I bet there\u2019s still much to discover.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_shint_3_3": "Despite all that hard work, it seems you\u2019ve still got a little spark left in you\u2014so why don\u2019t you head back out and see what other adventures await? Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! It is fortunate you are here. Alarming events have transpired.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_0_1": "As I was observing a slow, pink Pok\u00e9mon, its tail suddenly fell off. I stooped down to pick up the tail, only to discover that the field was covered in more of these detached appendages.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_0_2": "The Pok\u00e9mon in question did not seem perturbed. However, I am. Could a disease be ailing the Pok\u00e9mon? Are the fallen extremities separate life-forms?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_0_3": "Please assist me in assessing the situation, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! I saw you and Rhi running around earlier. What\u2019ve you been up to?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_1": "There were Pok\u00e9mon with their tails falling off? That does sound concerning, but I\u2019ve got a hunch there\u2019s nothing to worry about. Let me have a look!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_2": "Hmm... Yep! You\u2019ll both be relieved to know these are just Slowpoke tails. Their tails fall off naturally. The Slowpoke don\u2019t feel any pain when it happens, and their tails grow back, so they aren\u2019t particularly bothered.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_3": "Speaking of their tails, did you know that because Galarian Slowpoke eat the seeds of a plant that grows only in Galar, their tails have developed a spicy flavor?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_4": "So I hear, at least\u2014I\u2019ve never tasted one myself. Ooh, maybe we should have a picnic sometime!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_1_5": "Ahem. Lunch plans aside, I\u2019ll let Rhi know that there\u2019s no cause for concern. Spend more time with the Slowpoke till I\u2019m back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Whoa! Not only have you spent more time with Slowpoke, but you\u2019ve helped some evolve, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_1": "Slowpoke\u2019s pretty special. Not only can it evolve into one of two different Pok\u00e9mon\u2014Slowbro and Slowking\u2014but each of its Evolutions has regional variants, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_2": "Slowpoke become Water- and Psychic-type Slowbro when Shellder latch on to their tails. Though usually dim-witted, they seem to become inspired if those Shellder bite down.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_3": "Galarian Slowbro, unlike their non-Galarian counterparts, are Poison types.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_4": "When a Shellder bites one of them, it sets off a chemical reaction with the spices inside Slowbro\u2019s body, causing Slowbro to become a Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon. Pretty wild, huh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_2_5": "Evolve a couple more Slowpoke, and I\u2019ll have some fun facts about Slowking to share when you\u2019re back!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_0": "Back so soon, %PLAYERNAME%? You\u2019re faster than a Slowpoke, that\u2019s for sure! Now for those Slowking facts I promised you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_1": "Slowking undertake research every day in an effort to solve the mysteries of the world. They have incredible intellect and intuition. Whatever the situation, they remain calm and collected.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_2": "Galarian Slowking, on the other hand, have something of a spooky bent. While chanting strange spells, these Pok\u00e9mon combine their internal toxins with what they\u2019ve eaten, creating strange potions.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_3": "What do you think would happen if I drank one of those potions? Maybe I\u2019d turn into a Slowking myself. Who knows what I could accomplish with their level of intellect!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_4": "Ah... You\u2019re right, it might be hard for me to communicate like that. Either way, there\u2019s no end to the discoveries we can make about Pok\u00e9mon together\u2014even if my noggin remains Shellder-free! Haha.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_slowpoke_3_5": "The curiosity of friends like you and Rhi will take us far. I hope you two learned something today. Until next time, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Perfect timing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_1": "I just got back from a lengthy stroll in the sunshine. It\u2019s incredible how much a bit of fresh air can affect your energy and mood!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_2": "But that\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s got me feeling chipper. You see, I witnessed something quite interesting while I was out and about.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_3": "Perhaps in response to the abundant sunlight, a congregation of Snivy appears to have formed nearby.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_4": "I don\u2019t know about you, but this seems to me like a golden opportunity to research the Grass Snake Pok\u00e9mon. Could you lend me a hand?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_5": "They\u2019re known to be fairly calm, so you shouldn\u2019t have much trouble observing them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_0_6": "Good luck out there!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer! Great work.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_1": "I have some information for you on why Snivy are so fond of the sun.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_2": "These Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight. Much like the sunshine they crave, Snivy are quite bright!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_3": "They were first encountered in the Unova region, where they were known for their intelligence and calm demeanor. Fascinating!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_4": "While we continue researching their sudden appearance, could you evolve a Snivy for me? I\u2019d like to document its Evolution, Servine.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_1_5": "Take care when you do, however\u2014Servine is known for its masterful whipping techniques.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_0": "Wonderful work, %PLAYERNAME%! That\u2019s a mighty fine Servine.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_1": "Like Snivy, Servine is known as the Grass Snake Pok\u00e9mon. It moves along the ground as if sliding. Though it\u2019s far from sluggish, it won\u2019t hesitate to seek out the shadows of thick foliage to avoid attacks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_2": "Now that we\u2019ve properly documented Snivy and Servine, I\u2019d like to move on to Serperior, Snivy\u2019s final Evolution.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_3": "Serperior is known as the Regal Pok\u00e9mon, and much like Snivy and Servine, it also has a penchant for sunlight. It takes in solar energy and boosts it internally.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_2_4": "Could you evolve your Servine into Serperior for me, Trainer? It\u2019ll be a great boon to my research, and you\u2019ll have a powerful Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon to join your journey as well!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_0": "Fantastic work, Trainer! I have no doubt Serperior will prove a potent asset on your adventures.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_1": "It has an incredible ability to stop its opponents\u2019 movements with a single glare. Should the opponent prove bold enough to continue, Serperior will give its all in battle.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_2": "Having a Pok\u00e9mon like that by your side would be pretty inspiring, I\u2019d say!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_3": "Anyway, thanks again for all your help in this sun-soaked endeavor. I think I\u2019ll take one more walk before the day\u2019s done\u2014can\u2019t let weather like this go to waste!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_snivt_3_4": "Until next time, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_0_0": "Hey! %PLAYERNAME%! No time to explain\u2014take this Incubator and follow me, quick!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_0": "Phew! Appreciate the hustle, %PLAYERNAME%. Did you use that Incubator I gave you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_1": "I bet you\u2019re curious why we\u2019re in a hurry.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_2": "It\u2019s because Elekid ran off\u2014right as I took my eyes off it to put an Egg in that Incubator!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_3": "To be fair, this isn\u2019t the first time my Elekid\u2019s gotten a case of the zoomies. I think it just gets restless sometimes. And hey, chasing after it is a great way to get my daily steps in!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_4": "As for that Incubator, I had a feeling you\u2019d be up for helping me track down Elekid and thought, \u201cWhy not hatch an Egg along the way?\u201d",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_5": "Professor Willow tells me you\u2019re no stranger to hatching Pok\u00e9mon. I\u2019d love to hear all about your escapades, so c\u2019mon, dish!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_1_6": "Actually, hold that thought\u2014I think I see Elekid over thataway! After it, %PLAYERNAME%! We can chat on the way!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_0": "Wanna hear more about what I\u2019ve been up to?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_1": "Okay, so, I had this wild idea that exposing Pok\u00e9mon Eggs to different kinds of music might influence what interests they develop as they grow up.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_2": "No results yet, but I\u2019ve been making a lotta playlists. Ooh, you should share some of your favorite tunes with me later!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_3": "I\u2019m getting excited. Haha. Thinking about Pok\u00e9mon always amps me up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_4": "Like, how do they instinctively develop so many unique characteristics? And at the same time, they all have their own personalities!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_5": "For example, Elekid are known to rotate their arms to generate electricity, but they supposedly tire easily. And then there\u2019s my Elekid, who\u2019s always running off.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_6": "That\u2019s what makes my buddy so charming, though! I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_2_7": "What\u2019s your Buddy Pok\u00e9mon like, %PLAYERNAME%? You should ask it to join us while we track down Elekid. I\u2019m itching to see if your buddy\u2019s personality is anything like yours!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_0": "A-HA! Elekid spotted dead ahead! And it looks like it\u2019s tuckered itself out.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_1": "Our wild Pok\u00e9mon chase is finally coming to an end.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_2": "Y\u2019know, I bet things only went as smoothly as they did because you were here.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_3": "I didn\u2019t even have to worry about Team GO Rocket trying to mess with us!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_4": "Come to think of it, they\u2019ve been weirdly preoccupied lately... But hey, I\u2019m not about to look a gift Horsea in the mouth.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_5": "Enough about them, though. Thanks again for being my hero today, %PLAYERNAME%! I dunno how long it would\u2019ve taken me to chase down Elekid without your help.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spark_may23_3_6": "Well, I\u2019ve got places to be and Eggs to hatch, but don\u2019t be a stranger! Let\u2019s chat again real soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s great to see you again.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_1": "I wanted to tell you about what I saw on my morning walk today\u2014a herd of Spheal rolling across an icy lake!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_2": "Did you know that a Spheal always travels by rolling around on its ball-like body?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_3": "When the season for ice floes arrives, Spheal can be seen rolling about on ice and crossing the sea.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_4": "They\u2019re also covered in fluffy fur to keep them from feeling cold in icy climes. And I\u2019ll tell you, seeing them tumble to-and-fro warmed me right up, too!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_0_5": "Why don\u2019t you go check out some Spheal for yourself?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you\u2019ve brought some Spheal with you. Aren\u2019t they just the roundest?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_1": "According to my research, the Evolution of Spheal, Sealeo, seems to agree! Sealeo can occasionally be seen entertaining itself by balancing a Spheal on its nose as if juggling a ball.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_1_2": "In fact, when Sealeo sees just about anything for the first time, it tends to try juggling it on its nose! Why don\u2019t you evolve your Spheal and see for yourself?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_0": "Welcome back, Trainer\u2014and hello there, Sealeo!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_1": "I have some breaking news for you. Remember that icy lake I told you about earlier?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_2": "Well, it looks like something\u2019s broken it up, and now all the Spheal are splashing around in the water! They seem to be having fun, but I wonder what Pok\u00e9mon could have caused this.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_3": "My best guess is Walrein. Walrein is known to swim through frigid water while crushing icebergs with its grand, imposing tusks. Sounds pretty magnificent, if a bit imposing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_2_4": "Can you evolve your Sealeo so we can research Walrein ourselves?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_0": "You did it, Trainer! Walrein\u2019s tusks really are magnificent up close, aren\u2019t they?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_1": "Did you know that Walrein typically gather in herds of about 20 or 30? When a threat appears, the herd\u2019s leader will do whatever it takes to protect the group.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_2": "Nice to know they can look after themselves\u2014though considering those tusks, I don\u2019t think that was ever in doubt. Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_3": "I\u2019m sure your Walrein will protect you in battle as well. You already look like quite a powerful pair!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_sphet_3_4": "Thanks for going on this adventure with me today, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019ve learned a lot from the research you conducted. Until next time, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_0": "Oh, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve dropped by just in time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_1": "As I was out on my regular walk one evening, I stumbled upon this odd stone. Something told me to bring it back to my lab for further research, and ever since then, strange things have been happening.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_2": "Papers shifting around, water glasses tipping all by themselves...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_3": "When I tried using my computer to research it, I got an error message with the number 108 flashing! %PLAYERNAME%, can you help gather some data on nearby Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_0_4": "I have to believe we can solve these spooky occurrences with science!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, thanks so much for your help. I did some research on Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon, and I think there\u2019s a Ghost- and Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon that is bound to a strange stone.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_1": "I can\u2019t say for sure just yet, but it seems this Pok\u00e9mon may actually be composed of 108 spirits bound together. So maybe if we catch 108 Pok\u00e9mon, it will appear?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_1_2": "Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!  And...would you keep the light on in the lab for me? All this spooky research is making my hair stand on end.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_0": "Wow, %PLAYERNAME%! It seems we\u2019ve had a spooky brush with Spiritomb!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_1": "I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the weather, but I\u2019ve got the shivers! You know, I feel confident that we can solve anything together, %PLAYERNAME%, even when things get scary.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_spiritomb_2_2": "I'll be in touch soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_0": "Great to see you, %PLAYERNAME%! I was walking through a forest earlier and saw something amazing\u2014fountains of water, coming out of a river!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_1": "At first, I wondered who would install a fountain in the middle of nature.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_2": "But I saw the flash of a shell, and I realized our mystery architect must be a Squirtle!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_3": "Squirtle hide in their shells to protect themselves, then strike with spouts of water at every opportunity. That must\u2019ve been what I saw!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_4": "Squirtle is also known as a Pok\u00e9mon that aspiring Trainers from the Kanto region can choose to be their first-partner Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_0_5": "Why don\u2019t you have a look at the Tiny Turtle Pok\u00e9mon yourself?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were observing Squirtle, I happened upon a Wartortle with algae growing out of its shell!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_1_1": "Wartortle is Squirtle\u2019s Evolution. Ones with algae on their shells are very old, so imagine what that venerable Wartortle must have seen in its years!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_1_2": "Why don\u2019t you evolve one of your Squirtle? It\u2019ll be able to keep you company for a good long while.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! I wasn\u2019t exaggerating when I said Wartortle could keep you company for a long time\u2014they\u2019re said to live for 10,000 years!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_1": "Their furry tails are a symbol of longevity and become deeper in color as Wartortle age.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_2": "Isn\u2019t that fascinating? It\u2019s the opposite of humans!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_3": "And Wartortle don\u2019t just have incredible endurance\u2014they can also grow even stronger. When they evolve into Blastoise, they grow rocket cannons on their shells!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_2_4": "If you evolve a Wartortle, you can see it for yourself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_0": "Look at the rocket cannons on that Blastoise, %PLAYERNAME%! As you can see, Blastoise has spouts extending from the top of its shell.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_1": "Once Blastoise takes aim at an enemy, it can blast out water with more force than a fire hose.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_2": "That might be a fun way to cool down during a scorching summer, eh?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_3": "Blastoise would have to hold back in a pool party, though\u2014some researchers say the jets of water from Blastoise\u2019s rocket cannons can punch through thick steel.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_4": "But with a Trainer like you, I\u2019m sure everything will be under control, whether you and your Blastoise are out for some summer fun or engaged in a fierce battle!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_squirtle_3_5": "And speaking of summer fun, I\u2019ve got to get the inflatable pool set up for Meltan. Thanks for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you have a blast!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! You surprised me, much like the Seedot that just fell from that tree over there.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_0_1": "It really scared a Pidgey that was foraging nearby, and I\u2019m pretty sure it did that on purpose.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_0_2": "It\u2019s easy for Seedot to trick people and Pok\u00e9mon alike because Seedot are almost indistinguishable from acorns.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_0_3": "Are they appearing in higher numbers right now, or am I seeing double? Could you help me investigate this nutty situation?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were away, I was just refreshing my memory on Seedot.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_1_1": "Apparently, it attaches itself to a tree branch using the top of its head and sucks moisture from the tree it\u2019s hanging from. The more water Seedot drinks, the glossier its body becomes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_1_2": "Thanks, Seedot, for reminding us to stay hydrated! Did you know that Seedot can evolve? AHHH! Sorry, I was just startled by another one.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_1_3": "Why don\u2019t you try evolving Seedot? Maybe it\u2019ll get calmer and stop playing pranks on everyone!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_2_0": "On the one hand, fantastic work, Trainer. Your little Seedot has evolved into Nuzleaf, the Wily Pok\u00e9mon. On the other hand, our plan to calm Seedot down by evolving it has backfired.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_2_1": "Apparently, Nuzleaf can make a flute out of the leaf on its head, and the sound of that flute strikes fear and uncertainty into the hearts of people who hear it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_2_2": "I\u2019m sorry. But I have faith that a brave Trainer like yourself can handle Nuzleaf just fine!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_2_3": "Maybe if we try evolving it again...its next form will be less scary! Personally, I\u2019ve been startled enough for one day of research!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_3_0": "So...your Nuzleaf has evolved into Shiftry, the Wicked Pok\u00e9mon. Unfortunately, upon reviewing data on Shiftry, I learned it can be quite fearsome, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_3_1": "Using its leafy fan, Shiftry can create wind gusts with speeds of up to one hundred feet per second. That\u2019s strong enough to level houses! I think I need to go tie my mobile lab down!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_3_2": "I\u2019d rather be surprised by a Seedot than blown away by a Shiftry! Hah...lesson learned\u2014stay up-to-date with Pok\u00e9mon, even familiar ones!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_st_3_3": "Thank you for your help researching this odd occurrence. Once these winds die down, I\u2019ll be in touch about our next research adventure!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_0": "Greetings, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. You have arrived at a convenient time. I would like you to assist me.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_1": "I am only beginning to grow familiar with the sounds of this world. The rustling of leaves, the crashing of waves...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_2": "But today I hear a new\u2014there!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_3": "That high-pitched chattering and stirring of air. Is it some sort of natural phenomenon?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_4": "So you believe it to be caused by Pok\u00e9mon. Intriguing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_0_5": "I am eager to locate the source. Let us proceed.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_0": "So the multitude of Starly are the source of this cacophony.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_1": "Though diminutive, they flap their wings with great power. And when they form a flock...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_2": "I would not wish to be the target of their displeasure.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_3": "The strength of such a small creature is a marvel.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_4": "And if it were to evolve, I suspect that strength would only grow.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_5": "Evolution affects Pok\u00e9mon in such splendid ways. How will Starly change, do you think? Not another head, surely?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_1_6": "After our experience with Deino, little would surprise me. Nevertheless, I would like to witness this transformation for myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_0": "I am impressed yet again, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_1": "Staravia might not have grown an additional head, but it did increase in size.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_2": "My early observations indicate that Staravia, too, prefer to travel in a flock.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_3": "And when Staravia are not surrounded by their kind, they cry noisily. Perhaps they find comfort and security when together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_4": "I...can understand this.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_2_5": "Ahem. Does it evolve further? What changes might that bring?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_0": "Stunning. What a formidable physique.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_1": "This musculature of this Pok\u00e9mon\u2014Staraptor, is it?\u2014indicates great strength. It appears more than capable of carrying away its prey.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_2": "And, unlike Starly and Staravia, it appears not to travel in flocks. Curious.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_3": "The Pok\u00e9mon of this world have such fascinating social structures. Some are more comfortable with others, and some find contentment alone.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_4": "They are like humans in this way, do you not think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_5": "With each investigation we undertake, my understanding of your world is further illuminated.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_starly_3_6": "Thank you for your company, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. Until again.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_0": "*yawn* Hello, %PLAYERNAME%... You\u2019ll have to forgive my appearance, I was up late last night studying some nearby Rowlet. For as sleepy as they can be during the day, they sure perk right up at night!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_1": "Maybe it\u2019d help me relax if I had a soft, cute Pok\u00e9mon to hug... Like Stufful!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_2": "Stufful has an adorable appearance, but it hates to be hugged or touched in any way. Which is a shame because I\u2019ve heard its fur is a delight to pet!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_0_3": "I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get the chance to snuggle one\u2014for science, of course! Maybe you could bring me a Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%? Just to look at!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, you\u2019re back! And you\u2019ve brought a Stufful with you! It looks so soft and fluffy...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_1": "Er-hem! Despite their looks, Stufful are incredibly dangerous Pok\u00e9mon. A touch from anyone except a known friend sends Stufful into a surging frenzy!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_1_2": "For both our sakes, maybe we\u2019d better befriend it before we try to cuddle\u2014I mean, continue our research, don\u2019t you think? Why not try feeding Stufful a Berry or two, %PLAYERNAME%. Perhaps we can get closer to it that way.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_0": "Your Stufful seems friendlier already, %PLAYERNAME%! Speaking of friendly, have you heard that its Evolution\u2014Bewear\u2014has the habit of hugging its companions?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_1": "Once Bewear accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. But letting it do that is dangerous\u2014it could easily shatter your bones!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_2": "Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_2_3": "While I don\u2019t recommend you go hugging a Bewear anytime soon, there isn\u2019t any harm in trying to meet one! Why don\u2019t you evolve Stufful, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_0": "What a strong-looking Bewear you\u2019ve come back with, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_1": "What\u2019s that? You say I look a bit more frazzled than usual? Well...I may have tried to pet Stufful while you were away, and its flailing sent me flying so far someone could\u2019ve mistaken me for a bird Pok\u00e9mon. Haha\u2014ow...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_2": "On the bright side, I did get to both pet Stufful and experience its strength firsthand! Come to think of it, I have a colleague studying Pok\u00e9mon moves who\u2019d love to hear all about this...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_stufful_3_3": "I hope you\u2019ve had more luck bonding with your new Stufful and Bewear companions, %PLAYERNAME%. I think I\u2019m going to bow out and grab an ice pack...or six. Thanks for all your help today! Take care, I\u2019ll be in touch!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_0": "Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! I was just taking a moment to admire the weather here. Blue skies abound, with the fluffiest of clouds floating by.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_1": "I\u2019d love to just kick back and enjoy the tranquility of it all, but I\u2019ve observed some of the clouds moving rather...strangely.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_2": "Believe it or not, I believe some of them are actually flapping\u2014yes, like birds!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_3": "The first few times I saw it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, but as the motions grew more frequent, I began to suspect a Pok\u00e9mon was involved.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_0_4": "Mind going on a little jaunt to see what you can discover?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer! What have you discovered?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_1": "Ah\u2014Swablu! The Cotton Bird Pok\u00e9mon. Hmm... It\u2019s all beginning to make sense.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_2": "Swablu\u2019s cotton-like wings are so fluffy and white that, alongside their sky-blue bodies, Swablu can be easily mistaken for clouds in the sky.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_3": "At least until you catch them flapping, eh? Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_4": "Swablu apparently love to sit on people\u2019s heads. They look like fluffy hats!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_5": "Ah, and there it goes! Right on your head. Good timing, Swablu!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_6": "Fond as they are of their human perches, Swablu will take flight right away if their wings get dirty. Cleanliness begets comfort, after all.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_7": "A fascinating Pok\u00e9mon through and through, don\u2019t you think?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_8": "Evolving Swablu takes some effort, but I assure you\u2014it\u2019s well worth it! I\u2019m sure a Trainer of your talent could gather the necessary Candy in no time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_1_9": "I\u2019d love to see its Evolution in person, so could you evolve your Swablu for me? Be sure to use Pinap Berries to earn even more Candy!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_0": "Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%! Looks like you\u2019ve been hard at work catching Swablu.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_1": "Evolving Swablu is truly an act of patience, isn\u2019t it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_2": "Patience is often called a virtue in a broad sense, but it really is an integral part of being a great Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_3": "As the saying goes: good things come to those who wait!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_4": "All your hard work will feel justified once you witness your darling Swablu evolve. Of that, you have my word!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_2_5": "Just one more leg of this journey left to go, %PLAYERNAME%. Let's go!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_0": "Welcome back, Trainer! I see your efforts have paid off. Well done!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_1": "Swablu\u2019s Evolution, Altaria, is called the Humming Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_2": "It\u2019s known to wrap its wings around the people it\u2019s bonded with\u2014much like yours is doing with you now.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_3": "And humming all the while! You know, people say that Altaria\u2019s humming could enrapture an entire audience with its beauty, and it\u2019s not hard to see why.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_4": "Between Altaria\u2019s song and your remarkable bond, I have to say I\u2019m feeling quite moved!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_5": "You truly are an incredible Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_6": "Thanks for your help on this latest adventure, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll never get tired of learning more about Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swabt_3_7": "Now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_1": "Have you noticed all the Swinub out today? I wonder if there\u2019s something they find enticing buried around here.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_2": "After all, Swinub rub their snouts on the ground to find and dig up food. Their favorite food is mushrooms that grow under dead grass.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_3": "In fact, in ancient times, the people of Hisui relied on this skill.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_0_4": "Best we don\u2019t interrupt any Swinub mid-snuffle, but we can still spend some time observing them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_0": "You\u2019re right, some mushroom soup does sound good, Meltan\u2014",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_1": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%! Welcome back! Though I should\u2019ve heard you coming with those sniffing Swinub behind you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_2": "Swinub\u2019s Evolution, Piloswine, also has a sensitive nose. And their thick coat of long hair helps them endure freezing cold.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_3": "Sounds cozy, doesn\u2019t it? Maybe I should take a hint and grow my beard out during the winter months...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_4": "Ahem. You\u2019re right\u2014I\u2019m sure their hair is different from mine. The cold is nothing a good parka can\u2019t fix, anyway!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_1_5": "Let\u2019s have a look at Piloswine in person.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_2_0": "Is that a walking coat or a Piloswine, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_2_1": "Aw, not even a chuckle? I didn\u2019t expect my joke to get such a chilly reception! Haha.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_2_2": "I\u2019ll make it up to you with a cool fact\u2014Piloswine\u2019s Evolution, Mamoswine, has tusks made of ice! As the weather grows colder, its ice tusks grow longer, thicker, and more impressive.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_2_3": "What do you think Mamoswine\u2019s tusks will look like on a day like this?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! Mamoswine\u2019s tusks really are impressive!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_1": "It\u2019s hard to imagine anything could get the better of a Pok\u00e9mon this sturdy. In fact, this Pok\u00e9mon has been around a long, looong time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_2": "I recently read that a frozen Mamoswine was dug up from soil dating back 10,000 years ago. And it woke up, to my amazement!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_3": "In a way, seeing a Mamoswine today is like looking back in time.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_4": "What other Pok\u00e9mon that we see today were also around then? How have they changed?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_5": "All fascinating questions that require further research to answer. But what we\u2019ve observed of Swinub, Piloswine, and Mamoswine today is a great start.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_6": "Think on it as you go about the rest of your day, and come back soon to tell me your theories! But until then, thanks for spending the day with me.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_swinub_cdc_3_7": "Let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_0": "Hi there, %PLAYERNAME%. I can\u2019t help but be impressed by your progress. You\u2019ve done fantastic work in researching Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_1": "Now that we\u2019ve researched Pok\u00e9mon that were found in those regions...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_2": "let\u2019s take a closer look at Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Unova region!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_3": "I think it\u2019s fascinating that even though we know a lot about Pok\u00e9mon from all over the world, there\u2019s always more to learn!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_4": "Speaking of discoveries, I\u2019ve been doing some additional research and heard about an interesting phenomenon that has to do with Meowth in the Galar region.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_5": "I was speaking to a researcher who\u2019s the granddaughter of a colleague from Galar, and she shared some intriguing information.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_6": "It seems that Galarian Meowth lived with seafaring people, which toughened their bodies so much that parts of them turned to iron.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_7": "Maybe I could get a few workout tips\u2014I\u2019ve been looking for some ways to toughen up myself!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_0_8": "Anyway...let\u2019s do some more research on Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in Unova, but be sure to keep your eyes open for other exciting discoveries.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_0": "Wonderful work, Trainer. You might be familiar with the tradition in which a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer selects their very first partner from a group of three Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_1": "These first-partner Pok\u00e9mon are normally Fire, Water, or Grass types. In Unova, many Trainers choose the Water-type Oshawott as their first-partner Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_1_2": "This Sea Otter Pok\u00e9mon is known to use the scalchop on its stomach during battle. Isn\u2019t that just adorable? Please continue your research, and let me know your findings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_0": "I can\u2019t stop thinking about how cute Oshawott is... Oh! You\u2019re back! Excellent work catching that Darumaka!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_1": "Now that we\u2019ve researched the Water-type first-partner Pok\u00e9mon of many Trainers from Unova, let\u2019s shift focus to the Fire-type one\u2014Tepig!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_2": "I\u2019m a particular fan of Tepig because it uses the fireballs that come from its nose to roast Berries. It\u2019s such a clever use of a skill.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_2_3": "I just love roasted Pinap Berries! We should continue our work and see what else we can discover.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_0": "Being the savvy Trainer you are, I\u2019m sure you know which type of Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019re going to research next.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_1": "That\u2019s right\u2014Grass type! In Unova, many Trainers choose the Grass Snake Pok\u00e9mon Snivy as their first partner. Snivy is intelligent and calm, and being exposed to lots of sunlight makes it move more swiftly.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_2": "Perhaps there\u2019s a lot we could learn from such a sagacious Pok\u00e9mon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_3_3": "Anyway, let\u2019s get started on these research tasks. Be sure to listen carefully, as you never know what you might encounter!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_0": "You\u2019re a natural, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m so glad we could research some of the amazing Pok\u00e9mon originally discovered in the Unova region.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_1": "I can\u2019t thank you enough for your hard work. I hope you put this Charged TM and Fast TM to good use!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_2": "By the way, I literally stumbled across a mysterious Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve never encountered before.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcc_4_3": "I think you\u2019re the perfect Trainer to take this Pok\u00e9mon and help it reach its potential. Best of luck, and I\u2019ll be in touch soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Glad to see you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_1": "I was just thinking that it\u2019d be interesting to research more about my Buddy Pok\u00e9mon and the team leaders\u2019 buddies.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_2": "The four of us have powerful bonds with our buddies. Blanche has formed a wonderful relationship with Lapras, Candela has had Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, and Spark has developed an electrifying bond with Elekid.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_3": "My buddy is the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Meltan. Since Meltan and I met, I\u2019ve been documenting everything I learn about it. And trust me\u2014there\u2019s a lot to learn!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_4": "I\u2019ve actually heard some reports of Meltan sightings recently. Maybe you\u2019ll run into one on your adventures?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_0_5": "Definitely something to keep an eye out for as we begin our research. But first, let\u2019s stock up on some supplies!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer! Seems like you\u2019re all set to head out on this research adventure. Why don\u2019t we start by looking at the cool pair that is Blanche and Lapras?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_1": "Known as the Transport Pok\u00e9mon, Lapras is both Water- and Ice-type. A smart and kindhearted Pok\u00e9mon, it glides across the surface of the sea while its beautiful song echoes around it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_2": "Lapras are known to have gentle hearts and can even understand human speech. I completely understand why Blanche chose Lapras as a buddy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_3": "That said, Blanche clearly feels a special connection to Lapras.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_4": "Blanche got Lapras by trading with a fellow Team Mystic Trainer. I wonder if that has something to do with it.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_1_5": "At any rate, let\u2019s focus our research on Water- and Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon to learn more about the Pok\u00e9mon that Blanche holds dear.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_0": "Excellent work, %PLAYERNAME%. It looks like you have your very own Lapras, just like Blanche!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_1": "Be sure to tell your Lapras I said hi! I never miss a chance to greet new Pok\u00e9mon. Now, let\u2019s move on to our next dynamic duo: Spark and Elekid.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_2": "The leader of Team Instinct has always had a soft spot for Pok\u00e9mon that hatch from Eggs, so it\u2019s only natural that he\u2019d have a buddy like Elekid.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_3": "But don\u2019t let this Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s small stature fool you! Spark\u2019s Elekid is incredibly powerful, making it a fitting buddy for the energetic team leader.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_4": "Why hasn\u2019t Spark evolved his Elekid? Well, Evolution should be approached with care.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_5": "I\u2019m sure Spark will know when Elekid is ready to evolve.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_6": "Spark may seem pretty carefree, but few are more committed to the care and training of Pok\u00e9mon than him.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_2_7": "What do you say we research some Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon that Spark tends to work with?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_0": "How did your research go, Trainer? I think it\u2019s time to turn our attention to some Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon\u2014specifically the Fire Horse Pok\u00e9mon Rapidash.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_1": "This Pok\u00e9mon has a competitive streak, making it a great match for Candela, the leader of Team Valor.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_2": "Candela has had her Rapidash since it was a Ponyta, so you can be sure the two of them have been on more than a few adventures.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_3": "Rapidash loves to run and gallop, so Candela always makes sure her Buddy Pok\u00e9mon has plenty of time and space to do just that.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_4": "That kind of care is critical for building strong, lasting relationships with your Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_5": "Candela\u2019s passion and dedication make her a great role model for her fellow Team Valor members\u2014and everyone, really.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_3_6": "Maybe researching Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon will help you learn more about Candela\u2019s fiery spirit?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! Thanks for conducting that research on Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_1": "Now that we\u2019ve learned more about the Pok\u00e9mon that Blanche, Spark, and Candela call their buddies, it\u2019s time to do some research on my Buddy Pok\u00e9mon: Meltan.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_2": "I remember when I first met my Meltan. I was out doing some research when I stumbled upon a group of them. I\u2019d never seen a Pok\u00e9mon like it before, and I wanted to share my findings with my mentor, Professor Oak.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_3": "The group of Meltan eventually departed, but one Meltan stuck around, and we\u2019ve been together ever since!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_4": "At first, I assumed Meltan only stayed to snack on all the metal knickknacks in my mobile lab. But as time passed, our bond grew stronger, and now we\u2019re practically inseparable.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_5": "Our favorite thing is to go on long walks and look for metallic snacks for Meltan. Which reminds me\u2014we still need to look into those reports of Meltan appearing nearby!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_4_6": "Let\u2019s do some investigating and see if we can find any Meltan, Trainer!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_0": "Well done, Trainer! Thanks to your hard work, you have your very own Meltan!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_1": "I\u2019m sure that if you take the time to build up your relationship, Meltan will evolve into Melmetal in no time!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_2": "Melmetal stands over eight feet tall. By using centrifugal force, Melmetal can use its heavy hex-nut arms to deliver the strongest punches of all Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_3": "But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Now is the time to focus on the friendship between you and your Buddy Pok\u00e9mon\u2014whether it be Meltan or any other Pok\u00e9mon that you feel a special bond with.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_4": "After studying the bonds the team leaders and I have with our Buddy Pok\u00e9mon, I hope you feel inspired to find a buddy you can grow with as well.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_5": "I\u2019ve no doubt you and your Buddy Pok\u00e9mon will achieve some incredible things\u2014and Meltan and I will be cheering you on!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tcg1_5_6": "Thank again for your assistance. Until next time, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you again!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_1": "You know, I thought I smelled something sweet in the air today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_2": "Did I spill Berry juice again, you ask? You wound me, %PLAYERNAME%! As if I\u2019d ruin this snazzy new jacket!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_3": "Heh. In all seriousness, the smell was coming from outside.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_0_4": "Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have a chance to track down the source of the scent. But now that you\u2019re here, maybe you can sniff it out!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. Seeing as you\u2019ve got Teddiursa with you, I think I can connect the dots on what I was smelling earlier\u2014honey!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_1": "Teddiursa likes to lick its palms after soaking them in honey, so it\u2019s no wonder I caught a whiff.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_2": "That reminds me of a fun fact about Teddiursa\u2019s Evolution, Ursaring.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_3": "With its ability to distinguish any aroma, Ursaring unfailingly finds all food buried deep underground. If only it was that easy for me to find lunch!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_1_4": "Why don\u2019t you help Teddiursa evolve so you can see Ursaring\u2019s sleuthing skills for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_0": "I thought I heard something stomping about, and here you are, Ursaring in tow!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_1": "Here\u2019s the thing about Ursaring\u2014although it has a large body, it\u2019s quite skilled at climbing trees. It eats and sleeps in the treetops.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_2": "Ah, to be an Ursaring... Imagine how much easier that\u2019d make fieldwork\u2014or picking Pinap Berries!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_3": "Ahem. Snacks aside, have you noticed there\u2019s a full moon out early today?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_2_4": "Looks like Ursaring is staring at it, too. Think you can find out why, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_0": "Whoa! Could that be\u2014Ursaluna?!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_1": "I\u2019ve never seen one in these parts. What an incredible find! Hmm...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_2": "Maybe in the Hisui region of long ago, where Ursaluna was first discovered, the full moon played a part in how Ursaring evolved.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_3": "It\u2019s theorized that Hisui's swampy terrain gave Ursaluna its burly physique and ability to manipulate peat at will.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_4": "What kind of food would suit a Pok\u00e9mon accustomed to living in swamps? Grains? Beans? Cake?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_5": "Maybe I should get baking for some firsthand taste-testing. I bet Teddiursa could lend me some honey!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_6": "Ah\u2014listen to me yammering on and on. Researching Pok\u00e9mon first found in Hisui never fails to pique my curiosity about the past!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_teddiursa_3_7": "Thanks again for spending the day learning about Pok\u00e9mon with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I can always count on you to make my work a little sweeter!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! Good to see you. Do you have anything fun planned for today?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_1": "I\u2019ll be attending a picnic with the team leaders, myself.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_2": "I must say, though, I was having a pretty hard time deciding what I should bring. Candela\u2019s in charge of sandwiches, Spark is handling refreshments, and Blanche is bringing shaved ice, so the bases are all pretty well covered.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_3": "Walking always clears my head, so I took a stroll and ended up spotting a large group of Tepig near where I normally pick my go-to snack, Pinap Berries.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_4": "And suddenly\u2014inspiration! Did you know Tepig loves to eat roasted Berries, Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_5": "The Fire Pig Pok\u00e9mon blows fire balls through its nose and roasts the berries before it eats them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_0_6": "Roasted Berries sound like a great picnic snack, don\u2019t you think? And speaking of, I need to start getting them ready. Why don\u2019t you go check out the Tepig in the meantime?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_0": "Welcome back, Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_1": "Ah, I see you\u2019ve caught a Tepig of your own! They make terrific companions in all aspects of life.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_2": "Tepig evolves into Pignite, which, like Tepig, is known as the Fire Pig Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_3": "When Pignite\u2019s internal fire flares up, its movements grow sharper and faster. Whatever it eats becomes fuel for the flame in its stomach. Must do wonders for digestion!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_4": "Oh! That reminds me\u2014I need to check on my roasted Berries.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_1_5": "While I finish up my picnic preparations, why don\u2019t you see about evolving your Tepig into Pignite?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_0": "Hello again, %PLAYERNAME%. The Berry-roasting process is going swimmingly, and the whole place smells delicious!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_1": "Just when I thought Pok\u00e9mon couldn\u2019t inspire me any more than they already do, here I am taking cooking tips from Tepig. Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_2": "Nice Pignite, by the way! Very round. Did you know that Pignite can evolve? Its Evolution is a Pok\u00e9mon called Emboar.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_3": "Emboar is known to heat up its punches by setting its fists ablaze with its fiery chin. It\u2019s also known to care deeply about its friends.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_4": "Speaking of friends, I should let the team leaders know that I\u2019ll be on my way soon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_2_5": "How about evolving your Pignite into Emboar, Trainer? I\u2019d love to see its fiery beard firsthand.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_0": "Fantastic work, %PLAYERNAME%! Your Emboar is truly a sight to see!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_1": "This powerful Fire- and Fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon is known as the Mega Fire Pig Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_2": "According to my research, Emboar is a master of fast and powerful Fighting-type attacks.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_3": "And wow... Look at that beard of fire. What do you think, Trainer? Could you see me with one of those?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_4": "Haha, only joking! I\u2019m sure I\u2019d find it far too itchy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_5": "Anyway, I should let you get back to exploring. And I should get to that picnic!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_6": "Have a wonderful weekend, and keep up all the hard work. It\u2019s always a joy to see how much you\u2019ve grown as a Trainer each time we meet.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_7": "I\u2019ll be in touch soon with some more research opportunities. Or who knows\u2014maybe even some recipes!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tepit_3_8": "Now, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_0": "Rrrgh... Eight, nine, ten... Phew! Oh, hey there, %PLAYERNAME%. You caught me right at the end of my workout!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_1": "Being a Pok\u00e9mon Professor\u2019s not just about using your noodle\u2014I\u2019d argue it requires a strong body as well!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_2": "I\u2019m feeling even more inspired than usual to stay fit thanks to the recent inflex\u2014er, inFLUX of burly-looking Timburr.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_3": "Despite their smallish stature, these Pok\u00e9mon can lift and carry some serious lumber. They love helping out with construction projects.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_0_4": "Why don\u2019t you go catch a few Timburr so we can see their strength in action?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_0": "Great work catching those Timburr, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_1": "Check out how easily they carry those squared logs! Did you know Timburr carry bigger and bigger logs as they grow?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_2": "In fact, they love helping with construction so much that when rain causes work to stop, Timburr\u2019s mood gets a bit...stormy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_3": "It\u2019ll swing its log around and throw a tantrum!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_4": "Say, a few of your Timburr look like they\u2019re carrying some pretty big logs. I think they might be ready to evolve!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_1_5": "Why don\u2019t you help them out and show me when you\u2019re done, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_0": "Wow! Get a load of those Gurdurr!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_1": "Gurdurr take great pride in their awe-inspiring muscles, and like to show them off to Machoke and other Gurdurr.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_2": "It\u2019s so strong that even a group of wrestlers can\u2019t make it budge an inch! Now that\u2019s a fitness goal I\u2019d like to hit one day.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_3": "One thing to note is that unlike Timburr, Gurdurr\u2019s strength is best applied to demolition rather than construction. They skillfully wield steel beams to take down buildings!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_2_4": "Gurdurr evolves into quite the fascinating Pok\u00e9mon as well. Why don\u2019t you help one evolve so we can observe it more closely?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_0": "Great job evolving your Gurdurr into Conkeldurr, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_1": "Rather than relying on sheer force, Conkeldurr takes a more sophisticated approach to battle. Did you notice those concrete pillars it uses as walking canes?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_2": "Conkeldurr spins those around and uses centrifugal force to defeat its opponents.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_3": "Conkeldurr\u2019s mastery of concrete is well documented. Some of my colleagues believe that Conkeldurr actually taught humans how to make concrete more than 2,000 years ago!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_4": "Somehow, the concrete that Conkeldurr mixes is more durable than what humans can create.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_5": "There\u2019s so much more to this Pok\u00e9mon than meets the eye\u2014truly an inspiration to those of us who aim to sharpen both our minds and bodies!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_timburr_3_6": "And with our research finished for the day, I\u2019d say it\u2019s time for my cooldown lap. Thanks for spending the day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll see you again soon!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_0_0": "There you are! I had a feeling I\u2019d see you today, %PLAYERNAME%.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_0_1": "Look at all the Togetic fluttering around. I\u2019ve never seen so many at once!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_0_2": "Togetic is said to be a Pok\u00e9mon that brings good fortune, and what better fortune could I have than running into you?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_0_3": "Let\u2019s see what other good things lie in store for us as we continue observing these Togetic.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_0": "Your Togetic is positively glowing, %PLAYERNAME%! Could that glow be from Togetic\u2019s distinctive joy dust?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_1": "You see, research says that Togetic appear in front of kindly people to scatter a glowing down called \u201cjoy dust,\u201d showering them with happiness.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_2": "What practical applications could there be for joy dust? Will Pok\u00e9mon and humans feel joy upon seeing it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_3": "We researchers have yet to answer these questions. Just thinking of the possibilities is filling me with happiness!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_4": "But first things first. A kindhearted Trainer\u2014or Professor\u2014doesn\u2019t forget to take care of Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_1_5": "Let\u2019s share some happiness with Togetic by feeding them some Berries, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_2_0": "Nice work, %PLAYERNAME%. Those Togetic look positively jubilant.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_2_1": "Speaking of being jubilant, let me tell you about Togetic\u2019s Evolution, Togekiss! It\u2019s also known as the Jubilee Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_2_2": "Togekiss share their many blessings with people who respect one another\u2019s rights and avoid needless strife. It sounds like quite the wonderful Pok\u00e9mon to have around.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_2_3": "I bet you\u2019d have no trouble evolving Togetic into a Togekiss of your own. Why not give it a try?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_0": "Amazing, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ve evolved Togetic into your very own Togekiss!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_1": "These Pok\u00e9mon are never seen anywhere near conflict or turmoil. It\u2019s been depicted on good-luck charms since ancient times.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_2": "Speaking of bygone times, a researcher from long ago wrote, \u201cAfter studying what literature remains, I am certain Togekiss will reveal itself when peace reigns over the land.\u201d",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_3": "I know I\u2019m filled with peace and happiness whenever you reveal yourself to help with my research.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_togetic_3_4": "Thanks for spending another day with me, %PLAYERNAME%. Until next time, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_0": "Perfect timing, %PLAYERNAME%! I\u2019ve got an electrifying adventure lined up for you today.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_1": "I\u2019ve been monitoring some nearby waters and have picked up intriguing electrical signals.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_2": "If my hunch is correct, we\u2019ve got a school of the Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon Tynamo on our hands! Well, maybe not literally on our hands\u2014they\u2019re pretty zappy\u2014but you know what I mean.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_0_3": "See if you can spot any Tynamo out there. Even better if you can bring one back for us to study up close!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. I see I was right to charge you with researching Tynamo today!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_1": "I just learned that one Tynamo alone can emit only a trickle of electricity, so a group of them gathers to unleash a powerful electric shock.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_2": "And things get even more shocking once Tynamo evolves!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_1_3": "Why don\u2019t you try evolving your Tynamo into Eelektrik so we can study it together?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_0": "Incredible work, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Eelektrik has me en-wrap-tured! Get it? Because they coil around their prey!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_1": "Anyway... If you look closely, you can see these circular patterns along Eelektrik\u2019s body are actually electricity-generating organs.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_2": "That\u2019s why I always pack a pair of rubber gloves. You never know when you\u2019ll be handling Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_2_3": "Now, I think you\u2019re ready to take this research up a notch and evolve your Eelektrik into Eelektross!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_0": "Wow! What an achievement, %PLAYERNAME%. Your Eelektross has me totally amped!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_1": "Did you know that Eelektross\u2019 fangs have electricity running through them? It makes me glad I didn\u2019t become a Pok\u00e9mon dentist! Haha.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_2": "The fact that you\u2019ve befriended such a phenomenal Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon is grounds for celebration, I say!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_tynamo_3_3": "Keep up the fantastic work out there. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you again soon. Until then, let\u2019s GO!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_1": "Your timing is excellent. I\u2019ve hit a bit of a roadblock in my research!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_2": "You see, I\u2019m still puzzling over the guardian deities both Spark and Blanche have seen recently. I\u2019ve yet to suss out why they\u2019ve been appearing.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_3": "I can only hope they\u2019re not angry with us\u2014or worse!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_4": "I think I\u2019ll take a break in the shade to clear my mind. It\u2019s important to give your brain a breather now and then!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_0_5": "Why don\u2019t you head out to find some shade for yourself, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I see you\u2019ve found some leafy Pok\u00e9mon to rest under.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_1": "Are you feeling refreshed? I know I am!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_2": "While you were out, I thought of a new angle for our investigation.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_3": "As you may know, Alola is home to four guardian deities. We\u2019ve seen two, so it stands to reason the other two may be buzzing about already.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_4": "Instead of waiting for them to come to us, I think we should get out and search for them ourselves.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_5": "Let\u2019s start with Tapu Bulu, guardian deity of Ula\u2019Ula Island.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_6": "Ula\u2019Ula Island is a rugged locale, home to Mount Lanakila, the highest peak in Alola.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_7": "Tapu Bulu is said to make ringing sounds with its tail to let others know where it is and avoid unneeded conflicts. Knowing that, it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_1_8": "In addition, I know Tapu Bulu can help plants grow, so perhaps we\u2019ll have some luck if we begin by looking for Pok\u00e9mon that are known to grow. Let\u2019s get out there, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014you\u2019re back. How did your search go?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_1": "I asked Candela to lend us a hand shortly after you left.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_2": "And just a few minutes later, before I\u2019d even finished packing my gear, she came running back saying she\u2019d heard a ringing in the air and looked up to see Tapu Bulu floating by!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_3": "Yet another guardian deity I\u2019ve missed by a hair... Such is the fickle nature of Pok\u00e9mon research, I suppose.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_4": "I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve at least been more successful, %PLAYERNAME%. Now that we know it\u2019s out there, let\u2019s double down on our search for Tapu Bulu!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_2_5": "I\u2019ll speak with Candela to see if she might know any more details that could help us.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_ulaula_3_0": "%PLAYERNAME%\u2014you saw Tapu Bulu, didn\u2019t you!",

  "quest_special_dialogue_valentines_feb23_1_2": "Shame it\u2019s garden-variety pollen and not healing pollen from the Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 I\u2019ve seen around.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_2": "Quagsire are known to be easygoing\u2014so much that they couldn\u2019t care less when they bump their heads on boulders and boats while swimming!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_3": "Your Quagsire looks particularly carefree. It must know it\u2019s in the best possible hands with you as its Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_4": "Did you know that when it\u2019s time for Quagsire to eat, it lies at a river\u2019s bottom, waiting for prey to stray into its mouth?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_5": "Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t get hungry often, since it doesn\u2019t move much! Haha!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_2_6": "Now, we\u2019ve learned plenty about Quagsire, so let\u2019s turn our attention to Paldean Wooper\u2019s Evolution, Clodsire. Think you can bring one to me, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_0": "Welcome back! Let\u2019s take a closer look at Clodsire.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_1": "Clodsire are known to carry Wooper on their backs, ferrying them across water from one shore to the other.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_2": "But if Clodsire is provoked, it sticks thick spines out from its body. Let\u2019s...take care not to startle them.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wooper_3_3": "Phew! What an exciting day. My coat is caked with mud, but it was worth it to get some up-close research time with these intriguing Pok\u00e9mon.",

  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_1_2": "Excellent! You\u2019ve accomplished great things while working together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_1_3": "In fact, I\u2019ll bet teamwork is the key to advancing our research!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_1_4": "Why don\u2019t you join other Trainers on another adventure? I can\u2019t wait to see what Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ll find together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_0": "Hey, %PLAYERNAME%! Back from your adventure?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_1": "Let\u2019s take a peek at the Pok\u00e9mon you found with your party.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_2": "Wow, look at that! Another win for teamwork, I\u2019d say.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_3": "So many things become possible when you work together towards a common goal!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_2_4": "I know you and the other Trainers can make even greater discoveries if you join forces again.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! It\u2019s good to see you back.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_1": "And what a stupendous number of Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ve caught!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_2": "Thanks to you and your party\u2019s hard work, I have plenty to keep me occupied.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_3": "Thank you, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019m confident you have many exciting discoveries ahead, both with the Pok\u00e9mon you\u2019ll find and the people you\u2019ll meet.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wp_3_4": "After all, exploring the world together is one of life\u2019s greatest adventures.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_0": "Hey there, %PLAYERNAME%! I stepped out of my mobile lab this morning only to see needlelike horns poking out of the grass all around me.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_1": "Luckily, I also saw big red noses poking out of the grass and realized they belonged to Weedle, the Hairy Bug Pok\u00e9mon. I guess you could say we\u2019re in a...hairy situation!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_2": "...Uh, moving along...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_3": "Weedle\u2019s horn measures about two inches. It\u2019s a sharp stinger that can inject poison!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_0_4": "Let\u2019s investigate Weedle further\u2014but watch your step! There are Weedle everywhere, and you wouldn\u2019t want to get poked by one.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_0": "Nice footwork, Trainer. I read a fascinating tidbit while you were conducting your research\u2014Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_1": "It finds its favorite kinds of leaves by sniffing them out with its big, red, and\u2014in my opinion\u2014honkable nose.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_2": "I can think of a number of times this useful skill would come in handy, like when the team leaders start sharing snacks around the lab and don\u2019t think to offer me any.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_1_3": "Anyway, I think that we should look further into Weedle\u2019s Evolution. I can\u2019t wait to see what other fascinating details we learn.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_0": "Well done with that evolving, %PLAYERNAME%. However, it looks like the evolved form of Weedle, Kakuna, is just...sitting there. I knew this Cocoon Pok\u00e9mon didn\u2019t move much, but wow.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_1": "Seeing it in person has made me realize that...it really does just sit there. But while it seems like it\u2019s doing nothing, it\u2019s actually extremely busy preparing for its upcoming Evolution.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_2": "And that\u2019s evident by how hot to the touch the shell becomes! Isn\u2019t that exciting? Thanks to our research, we\u2019ve learned so much about what\u2019s happening to Kakuna!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_2_3": "Let\u2019s keep going! I think that Kakuna of yours is almost ready to show you what it\u2019s been working on.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_0": "Thanks to its hard work, Kakuna has evolved into Beedrill! It now has three poisonous stingers and wings that allow it to fly quickly. Talk about a glow-up!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_1": "Beedrill, the Poison Bee Pok\u00e9mon, is known for being extremely territorial. It sometimes attacks in swarms, and Beedrill nests are very dangerous!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_2": "This powerful Bug- and Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon may surprise you in Trainer Battles, too.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_wt_3_3": "Thanks for your help today, %PLAYERNAME%. I\u2019ll be in touch once I figure out how to maneuver my mobile lab out of this area. I wouldn\u2019t want a Weedle poking a hole in one of the mobile lab\u2019s tires!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_0": "%PLAYERNAME%! Thank goodness you made it to this important research site.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_1": "I came to study Pok\u00e9mon that commonly appear in this area, but it seems I need your help! The species of Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve observed today don\u2019t normally appear around here. What a strange occurrence!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_2": "Would you be willing to travel throughout the park and perform some tasks for me? With all these wild Pok\u00e9mon around, it almost feels like a safari!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_0_3": "Please complete the following research tasks: \n{0}\n{1}\n{2}\n{3}\n{4}",
  "quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_1_0": "Wow, great work today! In addition to completing some insightful research, you\u2019ve skillfully helped me document the amazing nature around us and the fascinating migration patterns that Pok\u00e9mon follow. I have a feeling there\u2019s even more to discover out here!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_yokosuka_1_1": "The results of your work have produced an awesome amount of Stardust. Perhaps you could find good use for it in powering up or trading a Pok\u00e9mon! Enjoy, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_0": "What peculiar coloring. Is it an aberration, or\u2014?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_1": "Ah. You have arrived at an opportune moment, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. Might I seek your insight?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_2": "Zigzagoon are present in vast numbers today, but they are notably different from those I have observed previously.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_3": "Zigzagoon\u2019s fur is normally earthy in hue, but these Zigzagoon are black and white.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_4": "Can you explain this?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_5": "I see... These Zigzagoon were first discovered in the Galar region.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_6": "So a single Pok\u00e9mon species can develop differently based on its habitat? Fascinating.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_0_7": "I will spend today observing these Galarian Zigzagoon. Will you assist me, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_0": "How energetic these Galarian Zigzagoon are. Have you also observed how they dash in a zigzag pattern?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_1": "I hypothesized that this may increase its evasiveness\u2014but when I tested it myself, I grew quite dizzy.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_2": "Fret not, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\u2014no people or Pok\u00e9mon were harmed during my experiment.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_1_3": "I am left wondering whether evolution would ease or encourage Galarian Zigzagoon\u2019s frenetic movements. Perhaps we can discover that answer together.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_0": "Thank you for your assistance, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_1": "I have concluded that Galarian Linoone\u2019s disposition is no calmer than Galarian Zigzagoon\u2019s. Indeed, its aggression appears to have increased.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_2": "Not long before your arrival, I observed a group of Galarian Linoone using their long tongues to taunt other Pok\u00e9mon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_3": "They then hurled themselves at their enraged foes.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_4": "I am continuously enthralled by the ways Pok\u00e9mon interact with each other.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_2_5": "Might Galarian Linoone itself be capable of evolution? More research is required.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_0": "Greetings, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. You have brought me...Obstagoon, is it?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_1": "Unlike Galarian Linoone, Obstagoon stands on two legs. I surmise this is to establish a threatening posture.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_2": "What\u2019s more, I witnessed firsthand its ability to make staggering vocal outbursts.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_3": "My heart has yet to return to its normal rhythm.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_4": "I find it remarkable that the assertive Obstagoon was once a diminutive Galarian Zigzagoon.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_5": "How must it feel to experience such profound transformation? I assume your Professor Willow would have some insight.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zigzagoon_3_6": "This has been a valuable learning experience. Thank you for your assistance today, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_0": "Hello, %PLAYERNAME%! What\u2019ve you been up to? Catching Pok\u00e9mon? Exploring a new Route, perhaps?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_1": "As for me, I\u2019ve been absorbed in reading a research article about the Order Pok\u00e9mon, Zygarde.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_2": "The writer hypothesizes that Zygarde monitors the ecosystem from deep within the cave where it lives. And when the ecosystem falls into disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_3": "I wonder if it ventures outside for other reasons. Here\u2019s an idea for a paper: \u201cZygarde Habitats and Migration Patterns\u201d!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_4": "What do you think? I wonder what other activities and locales might interest Zygarde...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_0_5": "Try to come up with a few theories while you\u2019re out exploring!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_1": "While you were out, I caught up on observational reports from local Trainers.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_2": "Curiously, several mentioned amorphous, green blobs they found along Routes. Some Trainers even thought they might be alive!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_3": "I have a theory about what those wobbly blobs might be, but I\u2019d like to review my research materials first. Maybe even reread that article from earlier...",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_4": "In the meantime, please continue your fieldwork. I\u2019m positive I\u2019ll have a less amorphous update by the time you get back.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_1_5": "Oh, and I suggest you power up your Pok\u00e9mon, just in case you run into anything unexpected out there!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_2_0": "There you are, %PLAYERNAME%! You\u2019ll never guess what happened!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_2_1": "As I combed through my notes, I saw something blur past me and come to a screeching halt outside the lab.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_2_2": "It moved fast, but I\u2019m almost positive it was the very Pok\u00e9mon I\u2019ve been investigating: Zygarde!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_2_3": "It might still be there. Check it out, and here\u2014take this. I\u2019ll explain how to use it once you\u2019re back.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_0": "Incredible, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_1": "So it really was Zygarde!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_2": "Zygarde is a curious Pok\u00e9mon. It\u2019s made of Zygarde Cells, and its appearance depends on the number of cells it has gathered.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_3": "I\u2019d say this one has about 10% of its cells. It\u2019ll change and grow as it collects more.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_4": "And that\u2019s what my gift is for! The Zygarde Cube can be used to store the Zygarde Cells that you find. You can think of it as a nest for those cells.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_5": "And as for where can you find those cells... Do you recall those green blobs that have been found along Routes? I reckon they were, in fact, Zygarde Cells!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_3_6": "Could I ask you to test that hypothesis, %PLAYERNAME%?",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_0": "Excellent work finding your first Zygarde Cell, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_1": "You\u2019re off to a great start to assembling Zygarde\u2019s forms, but there\u2019s a long journey ahead of you.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_2": "It looks like this Zygarde needs to collect 250 cells to reach its Complete Forme. It seems the cells are only gathering along Routes, so you\u2019ve got a lot of traveling in your future!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_3": "I can\u2019t wait for you to get started\u2014just think of all the Pok\u00e9mon and friends you\u2019ll meet on the way!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_4_4": "Explore a few more Routes, and I suggest you use an Incense while you\u2019re out there. We\u2019ve got to keep up with our studies of other Pok\u00e9mon as well!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%!",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_1": "You traveled five entire Routes?! Well done! That adventurous spirit is what makes you such a joy to work with.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_2": "I\u2019m sure Zygarde appreciates your perseverance too. And your efforts will be well-rewarded! In its Complete Forme, Zygarde has enough power to overwhelm even Xerneas or Yveltal.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_3": "Zygarde can radiate high-powered energy from the orifice on its chest. It uses force to neutralize those who harm the ecosystem.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_4": "That\u2019s some good motivation for us to each do our part, eh? Even little things, like recycling when we can. But I don\u2019t think we should need a threat to want to care for our surroundings.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_5": "After all, Pok\u00e9mon and even Trainers like yourself do their best in a healthy environment\u2014we should all work hard to make the world a place where everyone can thrive.",
  "quest_special_dialogue_zygarde_5_6": "I\u2019ll leave you with that thought, %PLAYERNAME%. Smooth travels on your journey to gather Zygarde Cells, and let me be the first to know when you\u2019ve collected enough to see its Complete Forme. I\u2019ll be waiting on the edge of my seat!",

  "sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_4": "As you have likely observed, more and more Ultra Beasts are appearing around you.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_5": "The one in your world now is known as UB-01 Symbiont. Certain humans also call it Nihilego.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_basic_3_6": "It is a Rock- and Poison-type Ultra Beast that is thought to produce a strong neurotoxin. It appears to be a parasite that lives by feeding on people and Pok\u00e9mon.",

  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_1": "They\u2019re particularly effective against Rock- and Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon like Nihilego, is it? I see. Your forethought is impressive.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_2": "I have decided it would be prudent of me to explore and better familiarize myself with the surrounding area. Would you like to accompany?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_3": "We can tell each other more about our worlds as we go.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_4": "I am once again thankful to have acquainted myself with someone so cordial.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_5": "There is still much for me to learn about this world, but it has been quite exciting thus far.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_4_6": "Come, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. Let us see what we can discover together.",

  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_1": "Judging by their dour expressions, I do not believe they\u2019re friends of yours.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_2": "Team GO Rocket, is it? Curious...",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_3": "Their presence unnerves me.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_5_4": "If they intend to cause us problems, may I rely on you?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_0": "Your skill in battle is effervescent, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer! Your aptitude assures me that Nihilego can be safely subdued.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_1": "May we now observe the Gyms where Nihilego has been appearing? Participating in Raid Battles may prove illuminating as well.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_2": "Hm? Ultra Beasts aren\u2019t the only creatures you\u2019ve encountered of late that are far from their homes?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_3": "I see... The Island Guardians of Alola, is it? Perhaps they sensed that the Ultra Wormholes would appear and came to assess how much of a threat they may pose to Alola.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_6_4": "The Alola region... I\u2019ve heard tell of its shine. But we haven\u2019t time for my wistfulness. Let us embark, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_0": "Shall we pause, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_1": "This is my first time in the field with another by my side. I apologize\u2014I\u2019ve yet to grow accustomed to the nuances of this dynamic.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_2": "How do you typically enjoy your rest in this world?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_3": "I see... Spending time with your Pok\u00e9mon and friends, hatching Eggs, and other such endeavors, is it?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_4": "I am enchanted by these \u201cIncubators\u201d that you place Eggs within.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_5": "They seem an amazing feat of human science. Would you provide me a demonstration?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_6": "Perhaps if we appear relaxed, Nihilego may respond in kind.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_7": "Though there is always a chance it may try to feast upon you\u2014but I will alert you if I notice such behavior in action.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_7_8": "To think I may soon witness Nihilego being captured in a Pok\u00e9 Ball...",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_0": "You were unfazed by that confrontation with Nihilego.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_1": "You seem unafraid of the unknown. It\u2019s an admirable trait.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_2": "Do you think Nihilego felt disoriented and alone when it found itself in an unfamiliar world? I feel a kinship with it in that way...",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_3": "I am lucky to have met a nice human so quickly. I hope Nihilego may also consider itself lucky to have encountered such a kind and accomplished Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_4": "In the end, Ultra Beasts are powerful creatures\u2014and not easily controlled.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_5": "Once they have arrived in a world, there is little left I can do...",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_6": "And yet you have managed to take it in gently as if it were any other Pok\u00e9mon. Selfishly, I wish for a closer look at Nihilego in this state. Do you have a way to observe it safely?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_7": "A \u201csnapshot,\u201d is it? What a delight.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_8_8": "Seeing Nihilego in this lucent world, I might even say it is...beautiful?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_0": "Your world is almost blindingly bright\u2014and more verdant than I\u2019ve ever experienced. I do hope you and your people take care to preserve its splendor.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_1": "Were I to exist in such a sparkling world, I would devote my power to its protection.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_10": "Would you mind if we continued our work as partners, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer?",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_11": "Our goals easily entwine. Together, we can accomplish and learn much.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_12": "You agree? Excellent. Now, our first course of action should be\u2014",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_13": "Wait. What are these flowers blooming about us? Is this what Pok\u00e9mon can do? Yours is truly a dazzling world...",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_2": "Judging by your recent actions, you seem to feel similar. You captured Nihilego, derailing disaster while seeking a solution to this world\u2019s new dilemma.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_3": "And regarding your Willow... I recently discovered this juice-stained coat near an Ultra Wormhole. There\u2019s no way to be certain, but it seems highly probable that your Willow is somewhere in Ultra Space.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_4": "But worry not, Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. I will work with you to rescue him. You have done me many favors\u2014it is only fair.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_5": "If this man is anything like you\u2019ve described, I have no doubt he\u2019ll be well in the end.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_6": "So long as Ultra Wormholes remain open here, we have a chance of his safe return\u2014but Ultra Beasts may also continue to spill into this world.",
  "sr_gofest2022_d2_nihilego_9_7": "For now, I\u2019ll see what else I can do to assist you.",

  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_1": "I assume you\u2019re the Trainer in question? Haha, but of course! I knew I could trust you.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_2": "So, my sleuthing turned up an interesting rumor. A Gyarados has been spotted nearby, but it isn\u2019t at all like your typical Gyarados.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_3": "This one seems like it\u2019s mired in a fit of rage\u2014not unlike a certain Red Gyarados that once rampaged the Johto region\u2019s Lake of Rage.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_4": "Back then, Team Rocket used a mysterious radio broadcast to force Magikarp to evolve.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_5": "Hm. That sounds similar to Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, don\u2019t you think? And there have been a lot more Shadow Pok\u00e9mon appearing lately. Could Team GO Rocket be using the same technology again?",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_6": "And is this connected to what they stole from behind the mysterious door? What if it was some sort of power that they\u2019ve now amplified and corrupted...?",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_4_7": "And with Celebi about and its time travel powers\u2014 Egad! Who knows what Team GO Rocket could do! There\u2019s no time to waste. Let\u2019s save Gyarados and then set our sights on finding Celebi before it\u2019s too late!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_0": "Great work, %PLAYERNAME%! That Gyarados is much calmer now that you\u2019ve rescued it from Team GO Rocket.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_1": "It looks like Team GO Rocket\u2019s retreating as well, so how about we continue with our festivities? They\u2019ve stolen enough of our time.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_chikorita": "I think your Bayleef would like to play with you!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_cyndaquil": "I think your Quilava would like to play with you!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_2_totodile": "I think your Croconaw would like to play with you!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_3": "Even in the direst of situations, when you\u2019re pulled from all sides, it\u2019s essential to take time to decompress and enjoy a peaceful moment with your friends.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_4": "Times like that give us the strength to persevere.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_chikorita": "Speaking of strength, your Bayleef looks ready to evolve!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_cyndaquil": "Speaking of strength, your Quilava looks ready to evolve!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_5_5_totodile": "Speaking of strength, your Croconaw looks ready to evolve!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_0_chikorita": "Ah, your Meganium is absolutely efflorescent with happiness! Are you two having fun? It\u2019s been a delight to see your friendship blossom.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_0_cyndaquil": "Ah, your Typhlosion is absolutely ablaze with happiness! Are you two having fun? It\u2019s been a delight to see your new friendship burn so brightly.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_0_totodile": "Ah, your Feraligatr is absolutely awash with happiness! Are you two having fun? It\u2019s been a delight to experience the refreshing friendship between you two.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_1": "Making new friends and exploring the world around you are two of life\u2019s greatest joys. My life is richer for the adventures I\u2019ve had.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_2": "I\u2019d have never found that mysterious door if not for a random adventure! Despite Team GO Rocket\u2019s interference, I\u2019m still grateful for the time I got to spend with the team leaders and the research I was able to do.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_6_3": "Enough of my chatter\u2014why don\u2019t you go make some new friends yourself? There\u2019s plenty of day left to enjoy.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_7_0": "%PLAYERNAME%, sorry to rush you, but we have to hurry! There\u2019s been a confirmed Celebi sighting just moments ago. If you go now, you might be able to catch it!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_7_1": "Let\u2019s GO!",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_0": "Great work catching Celebi! It is thought that so long as Celebi appears, a bright and shining future awaits us.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_1": "I wonder why Celebi decided to appear to us today. Maybe it\u2019s a sign of good things to come.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_2": "After all the trouble we\u2019ve had with Team GO Rocket, I welcome the reminder that peaceful times aren\u2019t too far off.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_3": "While you were out, I uncovered the truth Team GO Rocket has been trying so hard to hide: they\u2019ve captured Lugia and Ho-Oh.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_4": "It gets worse: using the power they stole from behind the mysterious door in conjunction with radio technology developed via their past broadcasts, they\u2019ve forced Lugia and Ho-Oh to ascend to a level of power beyond any Shadow Pok\u00e9mon we\u2019ve ever seen.",
  "sr_gotour2022_sr_dialogue_8_5": "They\u2019re calling them Apex Shadow Lugia and Apex Shadow Ho-Oh. Get ready, %PLAYERNAME%\u2014the battle\u2019s only just begun.",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_0": "Well hello, %PLAYERNAME%! How\u2019d you enjoy yesterday\u2019s festivities? I hope you\u2019re still feeling energetic, because there\u2019s more in store\u2014and this time, we\u2019re focusing on the Kanto region!",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_1": "What better place to start one\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon adventure, no?",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_0_2": "Now, let\u2019s get out there and start exploring!",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_1_0": "Ah, %PLAYERNAME%, you\u2019re looking a bit tired. Why not take a quick break? Play with your buddy a bit, maybe feed it a nice juicy Berry?",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_1_1": "While you\u2019re at it, why not grab a snack yourself! Even the strongest Trainers can\u2019t run on an empty stomach.",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_2_0": "Having fun, %PLAYERNAME%? Are you all warmed up for your next adventure? I hope so, because you\u2019ll soon be exploring the area\u2019s different habitats.",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_2_1": "There are five habitats, each filled with unique Pok\u00e9mon. Which habitats have which Pok\u00e9mon, you ask? Well, let\u2019s go find out!",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_0": "Nice snapshots, %PLAYERNAME%! You really captured the essence of the Pok\u00e9mon, and it looks like the little models were having a good time, too.",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_1": "Did you enjoy your excursion through the habitats? I bet you encountered an immense amount of Pok\u00e9mon, both familiar and new to you!",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_2": "There are tons of amazing Trainers out here exploring as well.",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_3_3": "Why not make a few new friends, then trade or battle with them?",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_4_0": "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! While you were out, I heard that a powerful Legendary Pok\u00e9mon has been sighted in the area.",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_4_1": "Maybe it heard about our festivities and wanted to join the fun? Let\u2019s go check it out!",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_5_0": "Whoa! Is that...Mewtwo? Incredible! Will the world\u2019s wonders never cease?",
  "sr_gotoursik_dialogue_5_1": "This has been such a fun day, %PLAYERNAME%. I hope you enjoy the rest of your adventure\u2014there\u2019s still plenty more to do. Until next time...let\u2019s GO!",
